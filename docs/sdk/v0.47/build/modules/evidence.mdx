## Abstract[​](#abstract "Direct link to Abstract")

`x/evidence` is an implementation of a Cosmos SDK module, per [ADR 009](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-009-evidence-module.md), that allows for the submission and handling of arbitrary evidence of misbehavior such as equivocation and counterfactual signing.

The evidence module differs from standard evidence handling which typically expects the underlying consensus engine, e.g. CometBFT, to automatically submit evidence when it is discovered by allowing clients and foreign chains to submit more complex evidence directly.

All concrete evidence types must implement the `Evidence` interface contract. Submitted `Evidence` is first routed through the evidence module's `Router` in which it attempts to find a corresponding registered `Handler` for that specific `Evidence` type. Each `Evidence` type must have a `Handler` registered with the evidence module's keeper in order for it to be successfully routed and executed.

Each corresponding handler must also fulfill the `Handler` interface contract. The `Handler` for a given `Evidence` type can perform any arbitrary state transitions such as slashing, jailing, and tombstoning.

## Concepts[​](#concepts "Direct link to Concepts")

### Evidence[​](#evidence "Direct link to Evidence")

Any concrete type of evidence submitted to the `x/evidence` module must fulfill the `Evidence` contract outlined below. Not all concrete types of evidence will fulfill this contract in the same way and some data may be entirely irrelevant to certain types of evidence. An additional `ValidatorEvidence`, which extends `Evidence`, has also been created to define a contract for evidence against malicious validators.

```
// Evidence defines the contract which concrete evidence types of misbehavior// must implement.type Evidence interface {    proto.Message    Route() string    String() string    Hash() []byte    ValidateBasic() error    // Height at which the infraction occurred    GetHeight() int64}// ValidatorEvidence extends Evidence interface to define contract// for evidence against malicious validatorstype ValidatorEvidence interface {    Evidence    // The consensus address of the malicious validator at time of infraction    GetConsensusAddress() sdk.ConsAddress    // The total power of the malicious validator at time of infraction    GetValidatorPower() int64    // The total validator set power at time of infraction    GetTotalPower() int64}
```

### Registration & Handling[​](#registration--handling "Direct link to Registration & Handling")

The `x/evidence` module must first know about all types of evidence it is expected to handle. This is accomplished by registering the `Route` method in the `Evidence` contract with what is known as a `Router` (defined below). The `Router` accepts `Evidence` and attempts to find the corresponding `Handler` for the `Evidence` via the `Route` method.

```
type Router interface {  AddRoute(r string, h Handler) Router  HasRoute(r string) bool  GetRoute(path string) Handler  Seal()  Sealed() bool}
```

The `Handler` (defined below) is responsible for executing the entirety of the business logic for handling `Evidence`. This typically includes validating the evidence, both stateless checks via `ValidateBasic` and stateful checks via any keepers provided to the `Handler`. In addition, the `Handler` may also perform capabilities such as slashing and jailing a validator. All `Evidence` handled by the `Handler` should be persisted.

```
// Handler defines an agnostic Evidence handler. The handler is responsible// for executing all corresponding business logic necessary for verifying the// evidence as valid. In addition, the Handler may execute any necessary// slashing and potential jailing.type Handler func(sdk.Context, Evidence) error
```

## State[​](#state "Direct link to State")

Currently the `x/evidence` module only stores valid submitted `Evidence` in state. The evidence state is also stored and exported in the `x/evidence` module's `GenesisState`.

```
// GenesisState defines the evidence module's genesis state.message GenesisState {  // evidence defines all the evidence at genesis.  repeated google.protobuf.Any evidence = 1;}
```

All `Evidence` is retrieved and stored via a prefix `KVStore` using prefix `0x00` (`KeyPrefixEvidence`).

## Messages[​](#messages "Direct link to Messages")

### MsgSubmitEvidence[​](#msgsubmitevidence "Direct link to MsgSubmitEvidence")

Evidence is submitted through a `MsgSubmitEvidence` message:

```
// MsgSubmitEvidence represents a message that supports submitting arbitrary// Evidence of misbehavior such as equivocation or counterfactual signing.message MsgSubmitEvidence {  string              submitter = 1;  google.protobuf.Any evidence  = 2;}
```

Note, the `Evidence` of a `MsgSubmitEvidence` message must have a corresponding `Handler` registered with the `x/evidence` module's `Router` in order to be processed and routed correctly.

Given the `Evidence` is registered with a corresponding `Handler`, it is processed as follows:

```
func SubmitEvidence(ctx Context, evidence Evidence) error {  if _, ok := GetEvidence(ctx, evidence.Hash()); ok {    return errorsmod.Wrap(types.ErrEvidenceExists, strings.ToUpper(hex.EncodeToString(evidence.Hash())))  }  if !router.HasRoute(evidence.Route()) {    return errorsmod.Wrap(types.ErrNoEvidenceHandlerExists, evidence.Route())  }  handler := router.GetRoute(evidence.Route())  if err := handler(ctx, evidence); err != nil {    return errorsmod.Wrap(types.ErrInvalidEvidence, err.Error())  }  ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(        sdk.NewEvent(            types.EventTypeSubmitEvidence,            sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyEvidenceHash, strings.ToUpper(hex.EncodeToString(evidence.Hash()))),        ),    )  SetEvidence(ctx, evidence)  return nil}
```

First, there must not already exist valid submitted `Evidence` of the exact same type. Secondly, the `Evidence` is routed to the `Handler` and executed. Finally, if there is no error in handling the `Evidence`, an event is emitted and it is persisted to state.

## Events[​](#events "Direct link to Events")

The `x/evidence` module emits the following events:

### Handlers[​](#handlers "Direct link to Handlers")

#### MsgSubmitEvidence[​](#msgsubmitevidence-1 "Direct link to MsgSubmitEvidence")

| Type             | Attribute Key  | Attribute Value  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| submit\_evidence | evidence\_hash | \{evidenceHash}  |
| message          | module         | evidence         |
| message          | sender         | \{senderAddress} |
| message          | action         | submit\_evidence |

## Parameters[​](#parameters "Direct link to Parameters")

The evidence module does not contain any parameters.

## BeginBlock[​](#beginblock "Direct link to BeginBlock")

### Evidence Handling[​](#evidence-handling "Direct link to Evidence Handling")

CometBFT blocks can include [Evidence](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/spec/abci/abci%2B%2B_basic_concepts.md#evidence) that indicates if a validator committed malicious behavior. The relevant information is forwarded to the application as ABCI Evidence in `abci.RequestBeginBlock` so that the validator can be punished accordingly.

#### Equivocation[​](#equivocation "Direct link to Equivocation")

The Cosmos SDK handles two types of evidence inside the ABCI `BeginBlock`:

* `DuplicateVoteEvidence`,
* `LightClientAttackEvidence`.

The evidence module handles these two evidence types the same way. First, the Cosmos SDK converts the CometBFT concrete evidence type to an SDK `Evidence` interface using `Equivocation` as the concrete type.

proto/cosmos/evidence/v1beta1/evidence.proto

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/proto/cosmos/evidence/v1beta1/evidence.proto#L12-L32)

For some `Equivocation` submitted in `block` to be valid, it must satisfy:

`Evidence.Timestamp >= block.Timestamp - MaxEvidenceAge`

Where:

* `Evidence.Timestamp` is the timestamp in the block at height `Evidence.Height`
* `block.Timestamp` is the current block timestamp.

If valid `Equivocation` evidence is included in a block, the validator's stake is reduced (slashed) by `SlashFractionDoubleSign` as defined by the `x/slashing` module of what their stake was when the infraction occurred, rather than when the evidence was discovered. We want to "follow the stake", i.e., the stake that contributed to the infraction should be slashed, even if it has since been redelegated or started unbonding.

In addition, the validator is permanently jailed and tombstoned to make it impossible for that validator to ever re-enter the validator set.

The `Equivocation` evidence is handled as follows:

x/evidence/keeper/infraction.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/x/evidence/keeper/infraction.go#L26-L140)

**Note:** The slashing, jailing, and tombstoning calls are delegated through the `x/slashing` module that emits informative events and finally delegates calls to the `x/staking` module. See documentation on slashing and jailing in [State Transitions](/v0.47/build/modules/staking#state-transitions).

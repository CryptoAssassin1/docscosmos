title: "Upgrading Cosmos SDK"
description: "Version: v0.47"
---

This guide provides instructions for upgrading to specific versions of Cosmos SDK. Note, always read the **SimApp** section for more information on application wiring updates.

## \[Unreleased][​](#unreleased "Direct link to \[Unreleased]")

### Migration to CometBFT (Part 2)[​](#migration-to-cometbft-part-2 "Direct link to Migration to CometBFT (Part 2)")

The Cosmos SDK has migrated in its previous versions, to CometBFT. Some functions have been renamed to reflect the naming change.

Following an exhaustive list:

* `client.TendermintRPC` -> `client.CometRPC`
* `clitestutil.MockTendermintRPC` -> `clitestutil.MockCometRPC`
* `clitestutilgenutil.CreateDefaultTendermintConfig` -> `clitestutilgenutil.CreateDefaultCometConfig`
* Package `client/grpc/tmservice` -> `client/grpc/cmtservice`

Additionally, the commands and flags mentioning `tendermint` have been renamed to `comet`. However, these commands and flags is still supported for backward compatibility.

For backward compatibility, the `**/tendermint/**` gRPC services are still supported.

Additionally, the SDK is starting its abstraction from CometBFT Go types thorought the codebase:

* The usage of CometBFT have been replaced to use the Cosmos SDK logger interface (`cosmossdk.io/log.Logger`).
* The usage of `github.com/cometbft/cometbft/libs/bytes.HexByte` have been replaced by `[]byte`.

### Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

A new tool have been created for migrating configuration of the SDK. Use the following command to migrate your configuration:

```
simd config migrate v0.48
```

More information about [confix](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/tooling/confix).

#### Events[​](#events "Direct link to Events")

The log section of abci.TxResult is not populated in the case of successful msg(s) execution. Instead a new attribute is added to all messages indicating the `msg_index` which identifies which events and attributes relate the same transaction

#### gRPC-Web[​](#grpc-web "Direct link to gRPC-Web")

gRPC-Web is now listening to the same address as the gRPC Gateway API server (default: `localhost:1317`). The possibility to listen to a different address has been removed, as well as its settings. Use `confix` to clean-up your `app.toml`. A nginx (or alike) reverse-proxy can be set to keep the previous behavior.

#### Database Support[​](#database-support "Direct link to Database Support")

ClevelDB, BoltDB and BadgerDB are not supported anymore. To migrate from a unsupported database to a supported database please use the database migration tool.

### Protobuf[​](#protobuf "Direct link to Protobuf")

The SDK is in the process of removing all `gogoproto` annotations.

#### Stringer[​](#stringer "Direct link to Stringer")

The `gogoproto.goproto_stringer = false` annotation has been removed from most proto files. This means that the `String()` method is being generated for types that previously had this annotation. The generated `String()` method uses `proto.CompactTextString` for *stringifying* structs. [Verify](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/13850#issuecomment-1328889651) the usage of the modified `String()` methods and double-check that they are not used in state-machine code.

### SimApp[​](#simapp "Direct link to SimApp")

#### Module Assertions[​](#module-assertions "Direct link to Module Assertions")

Previously, all modules were required to be set in `OrderBeginBlockers`, `OrderEndBlockers` and `OrderInitGenesis / OrderExportGenesis` in `app.go` / `app_config.go`. This is no longer the case, the assertion has been loosened to only require modules implementing, respectively, the `module.BeginBlockAppModule`, `module.EndBlockAppModule` and `module.HasGenesis` interfaces.

#### Modules Keepers[​](#modules-keepers "Direct link to Modules Keepers")

The following modules `NewKeeper` function now take a `KVStoreService` instead of a `StoreKey`:

* `x/auth`
* `x/authz`
* `x/bank`
* `x/consensus`
* `x/distribution`
* `x/feegrant`
* `x/nft`

User manually wiring their chain need to use the `runtime.NewKVStoreService` method to create a `KVStoreService` from a `StoreKey`:

```
app.ConsensusParamsKeeper = consensusparamkeeper.NewKeeper(  appCodec,- keys[consensusparamtypes.StoreKey]+ runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[consensusparamtypes.StoreKey]),  authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(),)
```

The following modules' `Keeper` methods now take in a `context.Context` instead of `sdk.Context`. Any module that has an interfaces for them (like "expected keepers") will need to update and re-generate mocks if needed:

* `x/authz`
* `x/bank`
* `x/distribution`

**Users using depinject do not need any changes, this is automatically done for them.**

#### Logger[​](#logger "Direct link to Logger")

The following modules `NewKeeper` function now take a `log.Logger`:

* `x/bank`

`depinject` users must now supply the logger through the main `depinject.Supply` function instead of passing it to `appBuilder.Build`.

```
appConfig = depinject.Configs(    AppConfig,    depinject.Supply(        // supply the application options        appOpts,+       logger,    ...
```

```
- app.App = appBuilder.Build(logger, db, traceStore, baseAppOptions...)+ app.App = appBuilder.Build(db, traceStore, baseAppOptions...)
```

User manually wiring their chain need to add the logger argument when creating the keeper.

#### Module Basics[​](#module-basics "Direct link to Module Basics")

Previously, the `ModuleBasics` was a global variable that was used to register all modules's `AppModuleBasic` implementation. The global variable has been removed and the basic module manager can be now created from the module manager.

This is automatically done for depinject users, however for supplying different app module implementation, pass them via `depinject.Supply` in the main `AppConfig` (`app_config.go`):

```
depinject.Supply(            // supply custom module basics            map[string]module.AppModuleBasic{                genutiltypes.ModuleName: genutil.NewAppModuleBasic(genutiltypes.DefaultMessageValidator),                govtypes.ModuleName: gov.NewAppModuleBasic(                    []govclient.ProposalHandler{                        paramsclient.ProposalHandler,                    },                ),            },        )
```

Users manually wiring their chain need to use the new `module.NewBasicManagerFromManager` function, after the module manager creation, and pass a `map[string]module.AppModuleBasic` as argument for optionally overridding some module's `AppModuleBasic`.

### Packages[​](#packages "Direct link to Packages")

#### Store[​](#store "Direct link to Store")

References to `types/store.go` which contained aliases for store types have been remapped to point to appropriate store/types, hence the `types/store.go` file is no longer needed and has been removed.

##### Extract Store to a standalone module[​](#extract-store-to-a-standalone-module "Direct link to Extract Store to a standalone module")

The `store` module is extracted to have a separate go.mod file which allows it be a standalone module. All the store imports are now renamed to use `cosmossdk.io/store` instead of `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/store` across the SDK.

#### Client[​](#client "Direct link to Client")

The return type of the interface method `TxConfig.SignModeHandler()` has been changed from `x/auth/signing.SignModeHandler` to `x/tx/signing.HandlerMap`. This change is transparent to most users as the `TxConfig` interface is typically implemented by private `x/auth/tx.config` struct (as returned by `auth.NewTxConfig`) which has been updated to return the new type. If users have implemented their own `TxConfig` interface, they will need to update their implementation to return the new type.

### Modules[​](#modules "Direct link to Modules")

#### `**all**`[​](#all "Direct link to all")

[RFC 001](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/rfc/rfc-001-tx-validation) has defined a simplification of the message validation process for modules. The `sdk.Msg` interface has been updated to not require the implementation of the `ValidateBasic` method. It is now recommended to validate message directly in the message server. When the validation is performed in the message server, the `ValidateBasic` method on a message is no longer required and can be removed.

#### `x/auth`[​](#xauth "Direct link to xauth")

For ante handler construction via `ante.NewAnteHandler`, the field `ante.HandlerOptions.SignModeHandler` has been updated to `x/tx/signing/HandlerMap` from `x/auth/signing/SignModeHandler`. Callers typically fetch this value from `client.TxConfig.SignModeHandler()` (which is also changed) so this change should be transparent to most users.

#### `x/capability`[​](#xcapability "Direct link to xcapability")

Capability was moved to [IBC-GO](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). IBC V8 will contain the necessary changes to incorporate the new module location

#### `x/gov`[​](#xgov "Direct link to xgov")

##### Expedited Proposals[​](#expedited-proposals "Direct link to Expedited Proposals")

The `gov` v1 module has been updated to support the ability to expedite governance proposals. When a proposal is expedited, the voting period will be shortened to `ExpeditedVotingPeriod` parameter. An expedited proposal must have an higher voting threshold than a classic proposal, that threshold is defined with the `ExpeditedThreshold` parameter.

##### Cancelling Proposals[​](#cancelling-proposals "Direct link to Cancelling Proposals")

The `gov` module has been updated to support the ability to cancel governance proposals. When a proposal is canceled, all the deposits of the proposal are either burnt or sent to `ProposalCancelDest` address. The deposits burn rate will be determined by a new parameter called `ProposalCancelRatio` parameter.

```
    1. deposits * proposal_cancel_ratio will be burned or sent to `ProposalCancelDest` address , if `ProposalCancelDest` is empty then deposits will be burned.    2. deposits * (1 - proposal_cancel_ratio) will be sent to depositors.
```

By default, the new `ProposalCancelRatio` parameter is set to 0.5 during migration and `ProposalCancelDest` is set to empty string (i.e. burnt).

#### `x/evidence`[​](#xevidence "Direct link to xevidence")

##### Extract evidence to a standalone module[​](#extract-evidence-to-a-standalone-module "Direct link to Extract evidence to a standalone module")

The `x/evidence` module is extracted to have a separate go.mod file which allows it be a standalone module. All the evidence imports are now renamed to use `cosmossdk.io/x/evidence` instead of `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/evidence` across the SDK.

#### `x/nft`[​](#xnft "Direct link to xnft")

##### Extract nft to a standalone module[​](#extract-nft-to-a-standalone-module "Direct link to Extract nft to a standalone module")

The `x/nft` module is extracted to have a separate go.mod file which allows it to be a standalone module.

#### x/feegrant[​](#xfeegrant "Direct link to x/feegrant")

##### Extract feegrant to a standalone module[​](#extract-feegrant-to-a-standalone-module "Direct link to Extract feegrant to a standalone module")

The `x/feegrant` module is extracted to have a separate go.mod file which allows it to be a standalone module. All the feegrant imports are now renamed to use `cosmossdk.io/x/feegrant` instead of `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/feegrant` across the SDK.

#### `x/upgrade`[​](#xupgrade "Direct link to xupgrade")

##### Extract upgrade to a standalone module[​](#extract-upgrade-to-a-standalone-module "Direct link to Extract upgrade to a standalone module")

The `x/upgrade` module is extracted to have a separate go.mod file which allows it to be a standalone module. All the upgrade imports are now renamed to use `cosmossdk.io/x/upgrade` instead of `github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/upgrade` across the SDK.

## [v0.47.x](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.0)[​](#v047x "Direct link to v047x")

### Migration to CometBFT (Part 1)[​](#migration-to-cometbft-part-1 "Direct link to Migration to CometBFT (Part 1)")

The Cosmos SDK has migrated to CometBFT, as its default consensus engine. CometBFT is an implementation of the Tendermint consensus algorithm, and the successor of Tendermint Core. Due to the import changes, this is a breaking change. Chains need to remove **entirely** their imports of Tendermint Core in their codebase, from direct and indirects imports in their `go.mod`.

* Replace `github.com/tendermint/tendermint` by `github.com/cometbft/cometbft`
* Replace `github.com/tendermint/tm-db` by `github.com/cometbft/cometbft-db`
* Verify `github.com/tendermint/tendermint` is not an indirect or direct dependency
* Run `make proto-gen`

Other than that, the migration should be seamless. On the SDK side, clean-up of variables, functions to reflect the new name will only happen from v0.48 (part 2).

Note: It is possible that these steps must first be performed by your dependencies before you can perform them on your own codebase.

### Simulation[​](#simulation "Direct link to Simulation")

Remove `RandomizedParams` from `AppModuleSimulation` interface. Previously, it used to generate random parameter changes during simulations, however, it does so through ParamChangeProposal which is now legacy. Since all modules were migrated, we can now safely remove this from `AppModuleSimulation` interface.

Moreover, to support the `MsgUpdateParams` governance proposals for each modules, `AppModuleSimulation` now defines a `AppModule.ProposalMsgs` method in addition to `AppModule.ProposalContents`. That method defines the messages that can be used to submit a proposal and that should be tested in simulation.

When a module has no proposal messages or proposal content to be tested by simulation, the `AppModule.ProposalMsgs` and `AppModule.ProposalContents` methods can be deleted.

### gRPC[​](#grpc "Direct link to gRPC")

A new gRPC service, `proto/cosmos/base/node/v1beta1/query.proto`, has been introduced which exposes various operator configuration. App developers should be sure to register the service with the gRPC-gateway service via `nodeservice.RegisterGRPCGatewayRoutes` in their application construction, which is typically found in `RegisterAPIRoutes`.

### AppModule Interface[​](#appmodule-interface "Direct link to AppModule Interface")

Support for the `AppModule` `Querier`, `Route` and `LegacyQuerier` methods has been entirely removed from the `AppModule` interface. This removes and fully deprecates all legacy queriers. All modules no longer support the REST API previously known as the LCD, and the `sdk.Msg#Route` method won't be used anymore.

Most other existing `AppModule` methods have been moved to extension interfaces in preparation for the migration to the `cosmossdk.io/core/appmodule` API in the next release. Most `AppModule` implementations should not be broken by this change.

### SimApp[​](#simapp-1 "Direct link to SimApp")

The `simapp` package **should not be imported in your own app**. Instead, you should import the `runtime.AppI` interface, that defines an `App`, and use the [`simtestutil` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/testutil/sims) for application testing.

#### App Wiring[​](#app-wiring "Direct link to App Wiring")

SimApp's `app_v2.go` is using [App Wiring](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-apps/app-go-v2), the dependency injection framework of the Cosmos SDK. This means that modules are injected directly into SimApp thanks to a [configuration file](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/simapp/app_config.go). The previous behavior, without the dependency injection framework, is still present in [`app.go`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/simapp/app.go) and is not going anywhere.

If you are using a `app.go` without dependency injection, add the following lines to your `app.go` in order to provide newer gRPC services:

```
autocliv1.RegisterQueryServer(app.GRPCQueryRouter(), runtimeservices.NewAutoCLIQueryService(app.ModuleManager.Modules))reflectionSvc, err := runtimeservices.NewReflectionService()if err != nil {    panic(err)}reflectionv1.RegisterReflectionServiceServer(app.GRPCQueryRouter(), reflectionSvc)
```

#### Constructor[​](#constructor "Direct link to Constructor")

The constructor, `NewSimApp` has been simplified:

* `NewSimApp` does not take encoding parameters (`encodingConfig`) as input, instead the encoding parameters are injected (when using app wiring), or directly created in the constructor. Instead, we can instantiate `SimApp` for getting the encoding configuration.
* `NewSimApp` now uses `AppOptions` for getting the home path (`homePath`) and the invariant checks period (`invCheckPeriod`). These were unnecessary given as arguments as they were already present in the `AppOptions`.

#### Encoding[​](#encoding "Direct link to Encoding")

`simapp.MakeTestEncodingConfig()` was deprecated and has been removed. Instead you can use the `TestEncodingConfig` from the `types/module/testutil` package. This means you can replace your usage of `simapp.MakeTestEncodingConfig` in tests to `moduletestutil.MakeTestEncodingConfig`, which takes a series of relevant `AppModuleBasic` as input (the module being tested and any potential dependencies).

#### Export[​](#export "Direct link to Export")

`ExportAppStateAndValidators` takes an extra argument, `modulesToExport`, which is a list of module names to export. That argument should be passed to the module maanager `ExportGenesisFromModules` method.

#### Replaces[​](#replaces "Direct link to Replaces")

The `GoLevelDB` version must pinned to `v1.0.1-0.20210819022825-2ae1ddf74ef7` in the application, following versions might cause unexpected behavior. This can be done adding `replace github.com/syndtr/goleveldb => github.com/syndtr/goleveldb v1.0.1-0.20210819022825-2ae1ddf74ef7` to the `go.mod` file.

* [issue #14949 on cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14949)
* [issue #25413 on go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/25413)

### Protobuf[​](#protobuf-1 "Direct link to Protobuf")

The SDK has migrated from `gogo/protobuf` (which is currently unmaintained), to our own maintained fork, [`cosmos/gogoproto`](https://github.com/cosmos/gogoproto).

This means you should replace all imports of `github.com/gogo/protobuf` to `github.com/cosmos/gogoproto`. This allows you to remove the replace directive `replace github.com/gogo/protobuf => github.com/regen-network/protobuf v1.3.3-alpha.regen.1` from your `go.mod` file.

Please use the `ghcr.io/cosmos/proto-builder` image (version >= `0.11.5`) for generating protobuf files.

See which buf commit for `cosmos/cosmos-sdk` to pin in your `buf.yaml` file [here](/v0.47/build/tooling).

#### Gogoproto Import Paths[​](#gogoproto-import-paths "Direct link to Gogoproto Import Paths")

The SDK made a [patch fix](https://github.com/cosmos/gogoproto/pull/32) on its gogoproto repository to require that each proto file's package name matches its OS import path (relatively to a protobuf root import path, usually the root `proto/` folder, set by the `protoc -I` flag).

For example, assuming you put all your proto files in subfolders inside your root `proto/` folder, then a proto file with package name `myapp.mymodule.v1` should be found in the `proto/myapp/mymodule/v1/` folder. If it is in another folder, the proto generation command will throw an error.

If you are using a custom folder structure for your proto files, please reorganize them so that their OS path matches their proto package name.

This is to allow the proto FileDescriptSets to be correctly registered, and this standardized OS import paths allows [Hubl](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/tools/hubl) to reflectively talk to any chain.

#### `{accepts,implements}_interface` proto annotations[​](#acceptsimplements_interface-proto-annotations "Direct link to acceptsimplements_interface-proto-annotations")

The SDK is normalizing the strings inside the Protobuf `accepts_interface` and `implements_interface` annotations. We require them to be fully-scoped names. They will soon be used by code generators like Pulsar and Telescope to match which messages can or cannot be packed inside `Any`s.

Here are the following replacements that you need to perform on your proto files:

```
- "Content"+ "cosmos.gov.v1beta1.Content"- "Authorization"+ "cosmos.authz.v1beta1.Authorization"- "sdk.Msg"+ "cosmos.base.v1beta1.Msg"- "AccountI"+ "cosmos.auth.v1beta1.AccountI"- "ModuleAccountI"+ "cosmos.auth.v1beta1.ModuleAccountI"- "FeeAllowanceI"+ "cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.FeeAllowanceI"
```

Please also check that in your own app's proto files that there are no single-word names for those two proto annotations. If so, then replace them with fully-qualified names, even though those names don't actually resolve to an actual protobuf entity.

For more information, see the [encoding guide](/v0.47/learn/advanced/encoding).

### Transactions[​](#transactions "Direct link to Transactions")

#### Broadcast Mode[​](#broadcast-mode "Direct link to Broadcast Mode")

Broadcast mode `block` was deprecated and has been removed. Please use `sync` mode instead. When upgrading your tests from `block` to `sync` and checking for a transaction code, you need to query the transaction first (with its hash) to get the correct code.

### Modules[​](#modules-1 "Direct link to Modules")

#### `**all**`[​](#all-1 "Direct link to all-1")

`EventTypeMessage` events, with `sdk.AttributeKeyModule` and `sdk.AttributeKeySender` are now emitted directly at message excecution (in `baseapp`). This means that the following boilerplate should be removed from all your custom modules:

```
ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(    sdk.NewEvent(        sdk.EventTypeMessage,        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyModule, types.AttributeValueCategory),        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeySender, `signer/sender`),    ),)
```

The module name is assumed by `baseapp` to be the second element of the message route: `"cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend" -> "bank"`. In case a module does not follow the standard message path, (e.g. IBC), it is advised to keep emitting the module name event. `Baseapp` only emits that event if the module has not already done so.

#### `x/params`[​](#xparams "Direct link to xparams")

The `params` module was deprecated since v0.46. The Cosmos SDK has migrated away from `x/params` for its own modules. Cosmos SDK modules now store their parameters directly in its repective modules. The `params` module will be removed in `v0.48`, as mentioned [in v0.46 release](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.1/UPGRADING.md#xparams). It is strongly encouraged to migrate away from `x/params` before `v0.48`.

When performing a chain migration, the params table must be initizalied manually. This was done in the modules keepers in previous versions. Have a look at `simapp.RegisterUpgradeHandlers()` for an example.

#### `x/gov`[​](#xgov-1 "Direct link to xgov-1")

##### Minimum Proposal Deposit At Time of Submission[​](#minimum-proposal-deposit-at-time-of-submission "Direct link to Minimum Proposal Deposit At Time of Submission")

The `gov` module has been updated to support a minimum proposal deposit at submission time. It is determined by a new parameter called `MinInitialDepositRatio`. When multiplied by the existing `MinDeposit` parameter, it produces the necessary proportion of coins needed at the proposal submission time. The motivation for this change is to prevent proposal spamming.

By default, the new `MinInitialDepositRatio` parameter is set to zero during migration. The value of zero signifies that this feature is disabled. If chains wish to utilize the minimum proposal deposits at time of submission, the migration logic needs to be modified to set the new parameter to the desired value.

##### New Proposal.Proposer field[​](#new-proposalproposer-field "Direct link to New Proposal.Proposer field")

The `Proposal` proto has been updated with proposer field. For proposal state migraton developers can call `v4.AddProposerAddressToProposal` in their upgrade handler to update all existing proposal and make them compatible and **this migration is optional**.

```
import (    sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"    "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/module"    v4 "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/gov/migrations/v4"    upgradetypes "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/x/upgrade/types")func (app SimApp) RegisterUpgradeHandlers() {    app.UpgradeKeeper.SetUpgradeHandler(UpgradeName,        func(ctx sdk.Context, plan upgradetypes.Plan, fromVM module.VersionMap) (module.VersionMap, error) {            // this migration is optional            // add proposal ids with proposers which are active (deposit or voting period)            proposals := make(map[uint64]string)            proposals[1] = "cosmos1luyncewxk4lm24k6gqy8y5dxkj0klr4tu0lmnj" ...            v4.AddProposerAddressToProposal(ctx, sdk.NewKVStoreKey(v4.ModuleName), app.appCodec, proposals)            return app.ModuleManager.RunMigrations(ctx, app.Configurator(), fromVM)        })}
```

#### `x/consensus`[​](#xconsensus "Direct link to xconsensus")

Introducing a new `x/consensus` module to handle managing Tendermint consensus parameters. For migration it is required to call a specific migration to migrate existing parameters from the deprecated `x/params` to `x/consensus` module. App developers should ensure to call `baseapp.MigrateParams` in their upgrade handler.

Example:

```
func (app SimApp) RegisterUpgradeHandlers() {    ----> baseAppLegacySS := app.ParamsKeeper.Subspace(baseapp.Paramspace).WithKeyTable(paramstypes.ConsensusParamsKeyTable()) <----    app.UpgradeKeeper.SetUpgradeHandler(        UpgradeName,        func(ctx sdk.Context, _ upgradetypes.Plan, fromVM module.VersionMap) (module.VersionMap, error) {            // Migrate Tendermint consensus parameters from x/params module to a            // dedicated x/consensus module.            ----> baseapp.MigrateParams(ctx, baseAppLegacySS, &app.ConsensusParamsKeeper) <----            // ...            return app.ModuleManager.RunMigrations(ctx, app.Configurator(), fromVM)        },    )  // ...}
```

The old params module is required to still be imported in your app.go in order to handle this migration.

##### `app.go` changes[​](#appgo-changes "Direct link to appgo-changes")

When using an `app.go` without App Wiring, the following changes are required:

```
- bApp.SetParamStore(app.ParamsKeeper.Subspace(baseapp.Paramspace).WithKeyTable(paramstypes.ConsensusParamsKeyTable()))+ app.ConsensusParamsKeeper = consensusparamkeeper.NewKeeper(appCodec, keys[consensusparamstypes.StoreKey], authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String())+ bApp.SetParamStore(&app.ConsensusParamsKeeper)
```

When using App Wiring, the paramater store is automatically set for you.

#### `x/nft`[​](#xnft-1 "Direct link to xnft-1")

The SDK does not validate anymore the `classID` and `nftID` of an NFT, for extra flexibility in your NFT implementation. This means chain developers need to validate the `classID` and `nftID` of an NFT.

### Ledger[​](#ledger "Direct link to Ledger")

Ledger support has been generalized to enable use of different apps and keytypes that use `secp256k1`. The Ledger interface remains the same, but it can now be provided through the Keyring `Options`, allowing higher-level chains to connect to different Ledger apps or use custom implementations. In addition, higher-level chains can provide custom key implementations around the Ledger public key, to enable greater flexibility with address generation and signing.

This is not a breaking change, as all values will default to use the standard Cosmos app implementation unless specified otherwise.

## [v0.46.x](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.46.0)[​](#v046x "Direct link to v046x")

### Go API Changes[​](#go-api-changes "Direct link to Go API Changes")

The `replace google.golang.org/grpc` directive can be removed from the `go.mod`, it is no more required to block the version.

A few packages that were deprecated in the previous version are now removed.

For instance, the REST API, deprecated in v0.45, is now removed. If you have not migrated yet, please follow the [instructions](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.45/migrations/rest.html).

To improve clarity of the API, some renaming and improvements has been done:

| Package   | Previous                           | Current                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `simapp`  | `encodingConfig.Marshaler`         | `encodingConfig.Codec`               |
| `simapp`  | `FundAccount`, `FundModuleAccount` | Functions moved to `x/bank/testutil` |
| `types`   | `AccAddressFromHex`                | `AccAddressFromHexUnsafe`            |

For the exhaustive list of API renaming, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

#### new packages[​](#new-packages "Direct link to new packages")

Additionally, new packages have been introduced in order to further split the codebase. Aliases are available for a new API breaking migration, but it is encouraged to migrate to this new packages:

* `errors` should replace `types/errors` when registering errors or wrapping SDK errors.
* `math` contains the `Int` or `Uint` types that are used in the SDK.
* `x/nft` an NFT base module.
* `x/group` a group module allowing to create DAOs, multisig and policies. Greatly composes with `x/authz`.

#### `x/authz`[​](#xauthz "Direct link to xauthz")

* `authz.NewMsgGrant` `expiration` is now a pointer. When `nil` is used, then no expiration will be set (grant won't expire).
* `authz.NewGrant` takes a new argument: block time, to correctly validate expire time.

### Keyring[​](#keyring "Direct link to Keyring")

The keyring has been refactored in v0.46.

* The `Unsafe*` interfaces have been removed from the keyring package. Please use interface casting if you wish to access those unsafe functions.

* The keys' implementation has been refactored to be serialized as proto.

* `keyring.NewInMemory` and `keyring.New` takes now a `codec.Codec`.

* Take `keyring.Record` instead of `Info` as first argument in:

  ```
    * `MkConsKeyOutput`  * `MkValKeyOutput`  * `MkAccKeyOutput`
  ```

* Rename:

  ```
    * `SavePubKey` to `SaveOfflineKey` and remove the `algo` argument.  * `NewMultiInfo`, `NewLedgerInfo`  to `NewLegacyMultiInfo`, `newLegacyLedgerInfo` respectively.  * `NewOfflineInfo` to `newLegacyOfflineInfo` and move it to `migration_test.go`.
  ```

### PostHandler[​](#posthandler "Direct link to PostHandler")

A `postHandler` is like an `antehandler`, but is run *after* the `runMsgs` execution. It is in the same store branch that `runMsgs`, meaning that both `runMsgs` and `postHandler`. This allows to run a custom logic after the execution of the messages.

### IAVL[​](#iavl "Direct link to IAVL")

v0.19.0 IAVL introduces a new "fast" index. This index represents the latest state of the IAVL laid out in a format that preserves data locality by key. As a result, it allows for faster queries and iterations since data can now be read in lexicographical order that is frequent for Cosmos-SDK chains.

The first time the chain is started after the upgrade, the aforementioned index is created. The creation process might take time and depends on the size of the latest state of the chain. For example, Osmosis takes around 15 minutes to rebuild the index.

While the index is being created, node operators can observe the following in the logs: "Upgrading IAVL storage for faster queries + execution on the live state. This may take a while". The store key is appended to the message. The message is printed for every module that has a non-transient store. As a result, it gives a good indication of the progress of the upgrade.

There is also downgrade and re-upgrade protection. If a node operator chooses to downgrade to IAVL pre-fast index, and then upgrade again, the index is rebuilt from scratch. This implementation detail should not be relevant in most cases. It was added as a safeguard against operator mistakes.

### Modules[​](#modules-2 "Direct link to Modules")

#### `x/params`[​](#xparams-1 "Direct link to xparams-1")

* The `x/params` module has been depreacted in favour of each module housing and providing way to modify their parameters. Each module that has parameters that are changable during runtime have an authority, the authority can be a module or user account. The Cosmos SDK team recommends migrating modules away from using the param module. An example of how this could look like can be found [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/12363).
* The Param module will be maintained until April 18, 2023. At this point the module will reach end of life and be removed from the Cosmos SDK.

#### `x/gov`[​](#xgov-2 "Direct link to xgov-2")

The `gov` module has been greatly improved. The previous API has been moved to `v1beta1` while the new implementation is called `v1`.

In order to submit a proposal with `submit-proposal` you now need to pass a `proposal.json` file. You can still use the old way by using `submit-legacy-proposal`. This is not recommended. More information can be found in the gov module [client documentation](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/07_client.html).

#### `x/staking`[​](#xstaking "Direct link to xstaking")

The `staking module` added a new message type to cancel unbonding delegations. Users that have unbonded by accident or wish to cancel a undelegation can now specify the amount and valdiator they would like to cancel the unbond from

### Protobuf[​](#protobuf-2 "Direct link to Protobuf")

The `third_party/proto` folder that existed in [previous version](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.45.3/third_party/proto) now does not contains directly the [proto files](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/release/v0.46.x/third_party/proto).

Instead, the SDK uses [`buf`](https://buf.build). Clients should have their own [`buf.yaml`](https://docs.buf.build/configuration/v1/buf-yaml) with `buf.build/cosmos/cosmos-sdk` as dependency, in order to avoid having to copy paste these files.

The protos can as well be downloaded using `buf export buf.build/cosmos/cosmos-sdk:8cb30a2c4de74dc9bd8d260b1e75e176 --output <some_folder>`.

Cosmos message protobufs should be extended with `cosmos.msg.v1.signer`:

```
message MsgSetWithdrawAddress {  option (cosmos.msg.v1.signer) = "delegator_address"; ++  option (gogoproto.equal)           = false;  option (gogoproto.goproto_getters) = false;  string delegator_address = 1 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];  string withdraw_address  = 2 [(cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.AddressString"];}
```

When clients interract with a node they are required to set a codec in in the grpc.Dial. More information can be found in this [doc](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/run-node/interact-node.html#programmatically-via-go).

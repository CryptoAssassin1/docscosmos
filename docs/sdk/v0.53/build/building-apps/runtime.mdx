title: "What is runtime?"
description: "Version: v0.53"
---

The `runtime` package in the Cosmos SDK provides a flexible framework for configuring and managing blockchain applications. It serves as the foundation for creating modular blockchain applications using a declarative configuration approach.

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The runtime package acts as a wrapper around the `BaseApp` and `ModuleManager`, offering a hybrid approach where applications can be configured both declaratively through configuration files and programmatically through traditional methods. It is a layer of abstraction between `baseapp` and the application modules that simplifies the process of building a Cosmos SDK application.

## Core Components[​](#core-components "Direct link to Core Components")

### App Structure[​](#app-structure "Direct link to App Structure")

The runtime App struct contains several key components:

```
type App struct {    *baseapp.BaseApp    ModuleManager    *module.Manager    configurator     module.Configurator    config           *runtimev1alpha1.Module    storeKeys        []storetypes.StoreKey    // ... other fields}
```

Cosmos SDK applications should embed the `*runtime.App` struct to leverage the runtime module.

simapp/app\_di.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0/simapp/app_di.go#L60-L61)

### Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

The runtime module is configured using App Wiring. The main configuration object is the [`Module` message](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0-rc.2/proto/cosmos/app/runtime/v1alpha1/module.proto), which supports the following key settings:

* `app_name`: The name of the application
* `begin_blockers`: List of module names to call during BeginBlock
* `end_blockers`: List of module names to call during EndBlock
* `init_genesis`: Order of module initialization during genesis
* `export_genesis`: Order for exporting module genesis data
* `pre_blockers`: Modules to execute before block processing

Learn more about wiring `runtime` in the [next section](/v0.53/build/building-apps/app-go-di).

#### Store Configuration[​](#store-configuration "Direct link to Store Configuration")

By default, the runtime module uses the module name as the store key. However it provides a flexible store key configuration through:

* `override_store_keys`: Allows customizing module store keys
* `skip_store_keys`: Specifies store keys to skip during keeper construction

Example configuration:

simapp/app\_config.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0/simapp/app_config.go#L133-L138)

## Key Features[​](#key-features "Direct link to Key Features")

### 1. BaseApp and other Core SDK components integration[​](#1-baseapp-and-other-core-sdk-components-integration "Direct link to 1. BaseApp and other Core SDK components integration")

The runtime module integrates with the `BaseApp` and other core SDK components to provide a seamless experience for developers.

The developer only needs to embed the `runtime.App` struct in their application to leverage the runtime module. The configuration of the module manager and other core components is handled internally via the [`AppBuilder`](#4-application-building).

### 2. Module Registration[​](#2-module-registration "Direct link to 2. Module Registration")

Runtime has built-in support for [`depinject`-enabled modules](/v0.53/build/building-modules/depinject). Such modules can be registered through the configuration file (often named `app_config.go`), with no additional code required.

simapp/app\_config.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0/simapp/app_config.go#L210-L216)

Additionally, the runtime package facilitates manual module registration through the `RegisterModules` method. This is the primary integration point for modules not registered via configuration.

<Warning>
  Even when using manual registration, the module should still be configured in the `Module` message in AppConfig.
</Warning>

```
func (a *App) RegisterModules(modules ...module.AppModule) error
```

The SDK recommends using the declarative approach with `depinject` for module registration whenever possible.

### 3. Service Registration[​](#3-service-registration "Direct link to 3. Service Registration")

Runtime registers all [core services](https://pkg.go.dev/cosmossdk.io/core) required by modules. These services include `store`, `event manager`, `context`, and `logger`. Runtime ensures that services are scoped to their respective modules during the wiring process.

runtime/module.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0/runtime/module.go#L201-L235)

Additionally, runtime provides automatic registration of other essential (i.e., gRPC routes) services available to the App:

* AutoCLI Query Service
* Reflection Service
* Custom module services

runtime/builder.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0/runtime/builder.go#L52-L54)

### 4. Application Building[​](#4-application-building "Direct link to 4. Application Building")

The `AppBuilder` type provides a structured way to build applications:

runtime/builder.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0/runtime/builder.go#L14-L19)

Key building steps:

1. Configuration loading
2. Module registration
3. Service setup
4. Store mounting
5. Router configuration

An application only needs to call `AppBuilder.Build` to create a fully configured application (`runtime.App`).

runtime/builder.go

```
loading...
```

[See full example on GitHub](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.53.0/runtime/builder.go#L26-L57)

More information on building applications can be found in the [next section](/v0.53/build/building-apps/02-app-building.md).

## Best Practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")

1. **Module Order**: Carefully consider the order of modules in begin\_blockers, end\_blockers, and pre\_blockers.
2. **Store Keys**: Use override\_store\_keys only when necessary to maintain clarity
3. **Genesis Order**: Maintain correct initialization order in init\_genesis
4. **Migration Management**: Use order\_migrations to control upgrade paths

### Migration Considerations[​](#migration-considerations "Direct link to Migration Considerations")

When upgrading between versions:

1. Review the migration order specified in `order_migrations`
2. Ensure all required modules are included in the configuration
3. Validate store key configurations
4. Test the upgrade path thoroughly

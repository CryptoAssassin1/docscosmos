`Confix` is a configuration management tool that allows you to manage your configuration via CLI.

It is based on the [CometBFT RFC 019](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/5013bc3f4a6d64dcc2bf02ccc002ebc9881c62e4/docs/rfc/rfc-019-config-version.md).

## Installation[​](#installation "Direct link to Installation")

### Add Config Command[​](#add-config-command "Direct link to Add Config Command")

To add the confix tool, it's required to add the `ConfigCommand` to your application's root command file (e.g. `<appd>/cmd/root.go`).

Import the `confixCmd` package:

```
import "cosmossdk.io/tools/confix/cmd"
```

Find the following line:

```
initRootCmd(rootCmd, moduleManager)
```

After that line, add the following:

```
rootCmd.AddCommand(    confixcmd.ConfigCommand(),)
```

The `ConfixCommand` function builds the `config` root command and is defined in the `confixCmd` package (`cosmossdk.io/tools/confix/cmd`). An implementation example can be found in `simapp`.

The command will be available as `simd config`.

<Check>
  Using confix directly in the application can have less features than using it standalone. This is because confix is versioned with the SDK, while `latest` is the standalone version.
</Check>

### Using Confix Standalone[​](#using-confix-standalone "Direct link to Using Confix Standalone")

To use Confix standalone, without having to add it in your application, install it with the following command:

```
go install cosmossdk.io/tools/confix/cmd/confix@latest
```

Alternatively, for building from source, simply run `make confix`. The binary will be located in `tools/confix`.

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

Use standalone:

```
confix --help
```

Use in simd:

```
simd config fix --help
```

### Get[​](#get "Direct link to Get")

Get a configuration value, e.g.:

```
simd config get app pruning # gets the value pruning from app.tomlsimd config get client chain-id # gets the value chain-id from client.toml
```

```
confix get ~/.simapp/config/app.toml pruning # gets the value pruning from app.tomlconfix get ~/.simapp/config/client.toml chain-id # gets the value chain-id from client.toml
```

### Set[​](#set "Direct link to Set")

Set a configuration value, e.g.:

```
simd config set app pruning "enabled" # sets the value pruning from app.tomlsimd config set client chain-id "foo-1" # sets the value chain-id from client.toml
```

```
confix set ~/.simapp/config/app.toml pruning "enabled" # sets the value pruning from app.tomlconfix set ~/.simapp/config/client.toml chain-id "foo-1" # sets the value chain-id from client.toml
```

### Migrate[​](#migrate "Direct link to Migrate")

Migrate a configuration file to a new version, config type defaults to `app.toml`, if you want to change it to `client.toml`, please indicate it by adding the optional parameter, e.g.:

```
simd config migrate v0.50 # migrates defaultHome/config/app.toml to the latest v0.50 configsimd config migrate v0.50 --client # migrates defaultHome/config/client.toml to the latest v0.50 config
```

```
confix migrate v0.50 ~/.simapp/config/app.toml # migrate ~/.simapp/config/app.toml to the latest v0.50 configconfix migrate v0.50 ~/.simapp/config/client.toml --client # migrate ~/.simapp/config/client.toml to the latest v0.50 config
```

### Diff[​](#diff "Direct link to Diff")

Get the diff between a given configuration file and the default configuration file, e.g.:

```
simd config diff v0.47 # gets the diff between defaultHome/config/app.toml and the latest v0.47 configsimd config diff v0.47 --client # gets the diff between defaultHome/config/client.toml and the latest v0.47 config
```

```
confix diff v0.47 ~/.simapp/config/app.toml # gets the diff between ~/.simapp/config/app.toml and the latest v0.47 configconfix diff v0.47 ~/.simapp/config/client.toml --client # gets the diff between ~/.simapp/config/client.toml and the latest v0.47 config
```

### View[​](#view "Direct link to View")

View a configuration file, e.g:

```
simd config view client # views the current app client config
```

```
confix view ~/.simapp/config/client.toml # views the current app client conf
```

### Maintainer[​](#maintainer "Direct link to Maintainer")

At each SDK modification of the default configuration, add the default SDK config under `data/vXX-app.toml`. This allows users to use the tool standalone.

### Compatibility[​](#compatibility "Direct link to Compatibility")

The recommended standalone version is `latest`, which is using the latest development version of the Confix.

| SDK Version | Confix Version |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| v0.50       | v0.1.x         |
| v0.52       | v0.2.x         |
| v2          | v0.2.x         |

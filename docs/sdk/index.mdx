The Cosmos SDK is a framework for building application-specific blockchains. It provides a modular architecture that allows developers to create custom blockchain applications with ease.

## Overview

The Cosmos SDK enables developers to build:

- **Custom blockchains** tailored to specific use cases
- **Modular applications** using pre-built and custom modules
- **Interoperable chains** that can communicate via IBC
- **Sovereign networks** with independent consensus and governance

## Core Modules

The Cosmos SDK includes several essential modules:

- **x/bank**: Token transfers and account balances
- **x/staking**: Proof-of-Stake consensus and delegation
- **x/gov**: On-chain governance and proposals
- **x/distribution**: Fee distribution and rewards
- **x/auth**: Account authentication and transaction signing
- **x/ibc**: Inter-blockchain communication protocol

## Cosmos EVM Integration

Cosmos EVM extends the Cosmos SDK with EVM compatibility:

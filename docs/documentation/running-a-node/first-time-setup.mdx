# Your First Cosmos EVM Node

Welcome! This guide will walk you through building and running a Cosmos EVM node from scratch. If you're new to blockchain nodes or the Cosmos ecosystem, don't worry - we'll explain everything step by step.

## What You're Building

A **node** is a computer that runs blockchain software and participates in the network. When you run a Cosmos EVM node, your computer:
- Stores a copy of the blockchain data
- Validates new transactions
- Can serve Ethereum-compatible RPC requests (if configured)
- Helps secure and decentralize the network

Think of it like running a local database server, but one that's synchronized with thousands of other computers worldwide.

## Before You Begin

### System Requirements

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **CPU**: 4 cores (2.0 GHz or faster)
- **RAM**: 8 GB
- **Storage**: 250 GB SSD (minimum, 500 GB recommended)
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04+, macOS 12+, or other Linux distributions
- **Internet**: Stable broadband connection

**Recommended for Production:**
- **CPU**: 8+ cores
- **RAM**: 16-32 GB
- **Storage**: 1 TB+ NVMe SSD
- **Internet**: 100+ Mbps with low latency

### Required Software

You'll need to install these tools first. Don't worry if you haven't used them before - we'll show you how!

#### 1. Install Go (Programming Language)

Cosmos EVM is written in Go, so we need Go installed to build it.

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
# Download and install Go 1.22
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add Go to your PATH
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation
go version
# Should output: go version go1.22.0 linux/amd64
```

**On macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew (install from brew.sh if you don't have it)
brew install go

# Verify installation
go version
```

#### 2. Install Git (Version Control)

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential

# Verify installation
git --version
```

**On macOS:**
```bash
# Git comes with Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Or using Homebrew
brew install git
```

#### 3. Install Make (Build Tool)

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
# Usually comes with build-essential
sudo apt install make

# Verify
make --version
```

**On macOS:**
```bash
# Comes with Xcode Command Line Tools
# Or install via Homebrew
brew install make
```

## Step 1: Download the Source Code

Now let's get the Cosmos EVM code from GitHub:

```bash
# Create a workspace directory
mkdir -p ~/cosmos-workspace
cd ~/cosmos-workspace

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/evm.git
cd evm

# Check available versions
git tag

# Checkout the latest stable version (replace with actual latest)
git checkout v0.4.0
```

> 💡 **What's happening?**  
> We're downloading the source code from GitHub and selecting a specific version to build. Using tagged versions ensures stability.

## Step 2: Build the Node Software

Time to compile the code into an executable program:

```bash
# Build the evmd binary
make build

# This creates the binary in ./build/evmd
ls -la build/

# Verify it worked
./build/evmd version
```

**Optional: Install globally** (makes it available from anywhere):
```bash
sudo make install

# Now you can use evmd from any directory
evmd version
```

> 📝 **Note:** The build process might take 2-5 minutes depending on your computer. You'll see lots of output - that's normal!

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

**"command not found: make"**
- Install make using the instructions above

**"go: command not found"**
- Go isn't installed or not in PATH. Revisit the Go installation steps

**"permission denied"**
- Use `sudo` for install command or check file permissions

## Step 3: Initialize Your Node

Before starting, we need to initialize the node's data directory and configuration:

```bash
# Choose a name for your node (moniker)
NODE_NAME="my-first-node"

# Initialize the node
evmd init $NODE_NAME

# This creates:
# ~/.evmd/config/ - Configuration files
# ~/.evmd/data/   - Blockchain data
```

**What just happened?**
- Created necessary directories
- Generated node keys (unique identity)
- Created default configuration files
- Set up genesis file (blockchain starting point)

Let's look at what was created:
```bash
ls ~/.evmd/config/
# app.toml       - Application configuration
# client.toml    - Client configuration  
# config.toml    - Consensus configuration
# genesis.json   - Initial blockchain state
# node_key.json  - Node's P2P identity
# priv_validator_key.json - Validator key (if validating)
```

## Step 4: Configure for First Run

For your first node, let's enable the Ethereum RPC server so you can interact with it:

```bash
# Enable JSON-RPC (Ethereum compatibility)
sed -i 's/enable = false/enable = true/' ~/.evmd/config/app.toml

# Or manually edit the file
nano ~/.evmd/config/app.toml
# Find [json-rpc] section and set enable = true
```

### Key Configuration Changes for Beginners

Edit `~/.evmd/config/app.toml`:

```toml
# Minimum gas prices (accept free transactions for testing)
minimum-gas-prices = "0aatom"

[json-rpc]
# Enable Ethereum JSON-RPC
enable = true

# Local access only (safe for testing)
address = "127.0.0.1:8545"
ws-address = "127.0.0.1:8546"

# Enable all APIs for testing
api = "eth,net,web3,debug,personal,txpool"

# Development-friendly settings
allow-insecure-unlock = true  # Only for testing!
allow-unprotected-txs = true  # Only for testing!
```

## Step 5: Start Your Node

### For Local Development (Single Node)

If you're just testing locally:

```bash
# Start the node
evmd start

# You'll see output like:
# INF starting node with ABCI CometBFT in-process module=server
# INF service start impl=multiAppConn module=proxy
# INF starting JSON-RPC server address=127.0.0.1:8545
```

**Keep this terminal open** - the node is running! Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### Connecting to a Network

To join an existing network, you need:
1. The network's genesis file
2. Seed nodes to connect to
3. Correct chain ID

Example for joining a testnet:
```bash
# Download genesis file (example)
curl https://example-testnet.com/genesis.json > ~/.evmd/config/genesis.json

# Add seed nodes in config.toml
sed -i 's/seeds = ""/seeds = "node-id@ip:26656"/' ~/.evmd/config/config.toml

# Start syncing
evmd start
```

## Step 6: Interact with Your Node

Once running, test your node in a new terminal:

### Check Node Status

```bash
# Check if node is running
curl -X POST http://localhost:26657/status | jq .

# Check Ethereum RPC
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

### Using MetaMask

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click network dropdown → "Add Network"
3. Add manually:
   - Network Name: `Local Cosmos EVM`
   - RPC URL: `http://localhost:8545`
   - Chain ID: `262144` (or your configured chain ID)
   - Currency Symbol: `ATOM`
4. Click "Save"

### Send Your First Transaction

```bash
# Create a test account
evmd keys add testuser

# Get test tokens (only works on local/test networks)
# You'll need to fund this account with tokens

# Check balance
evmd query bank balances $(evmd keys show testuser -a)
```

## Step 7: Running as a Background Service

For production or long-term use, run your node as a system service:

### Create Service File (Linux)

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/evmd.service
```

Add:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Cosmos EVM Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=YOUR_USERNAME
ExecStart=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/go/bin/evmd start
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=65535

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable evmd
sudo systemctl start evmd

# Check status
sudo systemctl status evmd

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u evmd -f
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Cannot connect to node"
- Check if node is running: `ps aux | grep evmd`
- Check ports aren't blocked: `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep evmd`
- Ensure firewall allows connections

### "Node not syncing"
- Check you have peers: `curl localhost:26657/net_info | jq .`
- Verify correct genesis file
- Check system time is accurate

### "Out of memory"
- Increase system swap space
- Adjust cache settings in `config.toml`
- Consider pruning old blocks

### "Disk full"
- Enable pruning in `app.toml`: set `pruning = "everything"`
- Move data directory to larger disk
- Consider running pruned node

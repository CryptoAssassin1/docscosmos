description: Comprehensive guide to Cosmos EVM node configuration parameters
---

Cosmos EVM nodes use three primary configuration files located in `~/.evmd/config/`:
- **`app.toml`** - Application-specific settings (EVM, JSON-RPC, state sync)
- **`config.toml`** - CometBFT consensus and networking settings
- **`client.toml`** - CLI client configuration

*Note: Implementation references are relative to the [cosmos/evm](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) repository.*

    ## Client Configuration

    Controls CLI client behavior and default settings.

    ```toml
    # chain-id
    # Purpose: Default chain ID for transactions
    # When to adjust: Set to your network's chain ID

    # keyring-backend
    # Purpose: Key storage backend
    # Options: os (system keyring), file (encrypted), test (plain text)
    # Security: Never use "test" in production
    # When to adjust: "os" for desktop, "file" for servers
    keyring-backend = "os"

    # keyring-default-keyname
    # Purpose: Default key for signing when --from not specified
    # When to adjust: Set for convenience in development

    # output
    # Purpose: CLI output format
    # Options: text (human readable), json (parseable)
    # When to adjust: "json" for scripting
    output = "text"

    # node
    # Purpose: RPC endpoint for queries and transactions
    # When to adjust: Point to your node or public RPC
    node = "tcp://localhost:26657"

    # broadcast-mode
    # Purpose: Transaction broadcast mode
    # Options: sync (wait for CheckTx), async (immediate), block (wait for commit)
    # When to adjust: "sync" for normal use, "block" for scripts needing confirmation

## Configuration Validation

The node validates configuration on startup:

- `tracer` must be: `json`, `struct`, `access_list`, `markdown`, or empty (server/config/config.go:220)
- `filter-cap` cannot be negative (server/config/config.go:277)
- `feehistory-cap` must be positive (server/config/config.go:281)
- TLS paths must use `.pem` extension (server/config/config.go:342-349)
- API namespaces cannot contain duplicates (server/config/config.go:318-325)
- `evm-chain-id` must differ from Cosmos chain-id

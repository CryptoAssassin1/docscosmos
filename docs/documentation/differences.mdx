<Warning>
  **The EVM module is still in active development:** Some of what is detailed here may change or be removed entirely as development continues. This document represents the current state of the implementation.
</Warning>

## Quick Summary

**Most Important Differences for Developers:**
1. **Instant finality** - No block reorganizations, transactions are final after one block
2. **1-2 second blocks** - Much faster than Ethereum's 12-15 seconds
3. **Configurable base fee** - Can be dynamic (EIP-1559) or disabled, distributed to validators instead of burned
4. **Native IBC** - Built-in cross-chain communication without bridges
5. **Cosmos precompiles** - Direct access to staking, governance, and other Cosmos SDK modules
6. **No pending state** - Transactions are either in mempool or committed
7. **EIP compatibility** - Most Core EIPs supported with some consensus-related exceptions ([see full matrix](/docs/documentation/eip-compatibility))

## Core Differences

| Aspect | Cosmos EVM | Standard EVM | Impact |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Transaction Ordering** | Arrival time to proposer\*\* | Gas price and nonce | Deterministic vs competitive ordering |
| **Transactions per Block** | One per EOA per block\*\* | Multiple per account | Simplified transaction flow |
| **Mempool** | No app-side mempool\*\* | Traditional mempool | Limited MEV opportunities |
| **Block Rewards** | Native token inflation to validators | Block rewards + tips | Different economic model |
| **Consensus** | Tendermint BFT | Proof of Work/Stake | 1-2 second vs 12+ second blocks |
| **Finality** | Immediate (single block) | Probabilistic (12+ confirmations) | No waiting period vs 12-15 minute finality |
| **Chain Reorganizations** | Not possible | Possible | Event handling simplified |
| **Address Formats** | Dual (0x... and cosmos1...) | Ethereum only (0x...) | Cross-format compatibility |
| **Gas Token** | Native chain token | ETH/derivatives | Chain-specific economics |
| **Base Fee** | Configurable (can be 0 or dynamic) | Dynamic based on demand | Chain-specific configuration |
| **Block Time** | 1-2 seconds | 12-15 seconds (varies by L2) | Faster transaction confirmation |
| **Cross-chain** | Native IBC | Bridge protocols | Built-in interoperability |

<footnote>
\*\*This will no longer be the case with the upcoming release of the [app-side mempool](https://www.notion.so/skip-protocol/EXT-Cosmos-EVM-Appside-Mempool-21e8c17818cb80028f28cfa440d7a7e7)
</footnote>

## Gas Price Behavior

<CodeGroup>
```solidity Cosmos EVM - BASEFEE Configurable
// May return 0 if NoBaseFee is true, or dynamic value if EIP-1559 is enabled
uint256 baseFee = block.basefee;

// BaseFee is distributed to validators (not burned)
// Lower-bounded by global min-gas-price
uint256 gasPrice = tx.gasprice;
```

```solidity Standard EVM - BASEFEE Burned
// Returns dynamic base fee
uint256 baseFee = block.basefee;

// Base fee is burned, not distributed
uint256 maxFee = baseFee * 2 + priorityFee;
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
Cosmos EVM supports EIP-1559 with dynamic base fees, but with key differences:
- Base fee is **distributed to validators** instead of burned (preserving token economics)
- Can be disabled via `NoBaseFee` parameter (returns 0 for `block.basefee`)
- Lower-bounded by global `min-gas-price` configuration
- Calculated based on previous block's gas usage when enabled
- Unlike Ethereum where base fee is burned, Cosmos EVM maintains token supply

## JSON-RPC Method Support

Cosmos EVM implements most standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods with some limitations due to consensus differences:

| Method Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| **✅ Core Methods** | `eth_getBalance`, `eth_call`, `eth_sendTransaction`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt` | Full compatibility |
| **⚠️ Gas Methods** | `eth_gasPrice`, `eth_estimateGas`, `eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas` | EIP-1559 partial - `eth_feeHistory` not implemented |
| **✅ Block Methods** | `eth_blockNumber`, `eth_getBlockByHash`, `eth_getBlockByNumber` | Immediate finality |
| **✅ Mining Stub Methods** | `eth_coinbase`, `eth_mining` (always false), `eth_hashrate` (always 0) | Returns static values for compatibility |
| **✅ Uncle Methods** | `eth_getUncleCount*` (always 0), `eth_getUncleBy*` (always null) | Returns expected values for no uncles |
| **⚠️ Debug Methods** | `debug_traceTransaction`, `debug_traceBlockByNumber` | Limited functionality, some issues |
| **❌ Admin Methods** | `admin_*` methods | Not implemented |
| **⚠️ Filter Methods** | `eth_newFilter`, `eth_newBlockFilter` | Filters created but `eth_getFilterChanges` fails |
| **⚠️ Personal Methods** | `personal_sign`, `personal_newAccount`, `personal_importRawKey` | Partial implementation |

For a complete list of all JSON-RPC methods with implementation status, see the [Ethereum JSON-RPC Methods](/docs/api-reference/ethereum-json-rpc/methods) reference.

### Additional JSON-RPC Methods

Cosmos EVM implements these non-standard methods:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `eth_getTransactionLogs` | Retrieve logs for a specific transaction |
| `eth_getBlockReceipts` | Get all receipts for a given block |
| `debug_freeOSMemory` | Force garbage collection |
| `debug_setGCPercent` | Configure garbage collector |
| `debug_memStats` | Return detailed memory statistics |

| `debug_writeBlockProfile` | Write block profile to file |
| `debug_writeMemProfile` | Write memory profile to file |
| `debug_writeMutexProfile` | Write mutex profile to file |

### Unimplemented Standard Methods

These standard Ethereum methods are not available:

| Method | Category | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `eth_getFilterChanges` | Filters | Filter management not implemented |
| `eth_getFilterLogs` | Filters | Filter management not implemented |
| `eth_feeHistory` | EIP-1559 | Fee history tracking not implemented |
| `eth_createAccessList` | EIP-2930 | Access lists not supported |

| All `admin_*` methods | Administration | Node administration not exposed |
| `eth_subscribe` syncing | WebSocket | Only newHeads, logs, and newPendingTransactions events supported |

## Address Format Examples

Cosmos EVM supports dual address formats with deterministic conversion:

```
Ethereum: 0x742d35cc6644c068532fddb11B4C36A58D6D3eAb
Cosmos:   cosmos1wskntvnryr5qxpe4tv5k64rhc6kx6ma4dxjmav
```

Both formats represent the same account and can be used interchangeably. Use the Bech32 precompile at `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000400` for conversion.

## EIP Compatibility

Cosmos EVM implements most Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) through the Geth EVM, with modifications for Cosmos consensus compatibility.

<Info>
  For a comprehensive searchable table of all 339+ Core EIPs with implementation status, see the **[EIP Compatibility Matrix](/docs/documentation/eip-compatibility)**.
</Info>

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Core EVM Features**: Most opcodes and execution features are inherited directly from Geth EVM
2. **Consensus-Related**: Features related to PoW/PoS consensus are not applicable due to Tendermint BFT
3. **Economic Model**: EIP-1559 implemented with modifications (fees to validators instead of burning)
4. **Future Support**: Critical EIPs like EIP-7702 are actively being developed

### Key EIP Implementation Differences

#### EIP-1559 (Dynamic Base Fee)
- ✅ Supported
- Base fee is **distributed to validators** instead of burned
- Can be disabled via `NoBaseFee` parameter
- Lower-bounded by global `min-gas-price`
- Maintains token supply unlike Ethereum

#### EIP-155 (Replay Protection)
- ⚠️ Different implementation
- Currently enforced at chain level rather than per-transaction
- Plans to align with Geth implementation for better compatibility
- See [GitHub Issue #401](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/issues/401)

#### EIP-7702 (Set Code for EOAs)
- 🚧 Coming in v0.5.0
- Will enable account abstraction capabilities
- Critical for wallet innovation and user experience improvements

#### EIP-2681 (Nonce Limit)
- ⚠️ Partial support
- Needs stricter overflow checking at AnteHandler
- See [GitHub Issue #400](https://github.com/cosmos/evm/issues/400)

### Consensus-Related EIPs (Not Applicable)

The following categories of EIPs are not applicable due to Cosmos using Tendermint BFT consensus:
- **Difficulty adjustments**: EIP-100, 649, 1234, 2384, 3554, 4345, 5133
- **Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake transition**: EIP-3675
- **Beacon chain operations**: EIP-4788, 4895, 7002, etc.
- **Validator deposits and withdrawals**: EIP-6110, 7044, 7045, 7251, 7514

## Additional Key Differences

### Transaction Execution
- **No pending state**: Transactions are either in mempool or committed, no intermediate "pending" state as in Ethereum
- **FIFO ordering**: Transactions processed in order of arrival (with app-side mempool changes coming)
- **Single transaction per block per EOA**: Currently limited to one transaction per account per block (changing with app-side mempool)
- **No transaction replacement**: Cannot replace pending transactions with higher gas price (no RBF)
- **Deterministic execution**: Same transaction order for all validators due to BFT consensus

### State and Storage
- **No state rent**: No storage rent or state expiry mechanisms
- **Pruning**: Historical state can be pruned based on node configuration
- **Archive nodes**: Full historical state requires archive node configuration

### Network Architecture
- **Validator set**: Fixed validator set with stake-based voting power
- **No light clients**: Full or archive nodes only, no light client protocol
- **P2P differences**: Uses Tendermint P2P networking instead of devp2p

### Developer Considerations
- **Gas refunds**: At least 50% of unused gas is refunded (configurable)
- **Revert reasons**: Full revert reason strings always available
- **Event reliability**: Events are immediately final, no need to wait for confirmations
- **Block timestamps**: More reliable due to BFT consensus requirements
- **Account abstraction**: EIP-7702 support coming in v0.5.0 for EOA code delegation
- **Opcode differences**: DIFFICULTY/PREVRANDAO returns 0, COINBASE returns empty address
- **Chain ID**: Enforced at chain level rather than per-transaction (EIP-155)
- **Storage costs**: No state rent mechanisms, pruning configurable per node

<Warning>
  **The EVM module is still in active development:** Some of what is detailed here may change or be removed entirely as development continues. This document represents the current state of the implementation.

  **Implementation Variations:** This document is specifci to the current version of [Cosmos-EVM](https://github.com/cosmos/evm) and may not be applicable in part or in full to older versions or Ethermint variants.
</Warning>

## Quick Summary

To ensure a familiar and seamless development experience for seasoned EVM builder teams, one of the main focus points of the Cosmos EVM project is to be affect developers, infrastructure operators, and users

**Most Important Differences for Developers:**
1. **Instant finality** - No block reorganizations, transactions are final after one block
2. **1-2 second blocks** - Much faster than Ethereum's 12-15 seconds
3. **Experimental pending state** - [Two-tiered mempool](/documentation/concepts/mempool) (local queue + public pool) handles nonce gaps and provides Ethereum-compatible pending functionality
4. **Configurable base fee** - Can be dynamic (EIP-1559) or disabled, distributed to validators instead of burned
5. **Native IBC** - Built-in cross-chain communication without bridges
6. **Cosmos precompiles** - Direct access to staking, governance, and other Cosmos SDK modules
7. **Token precision** - Native tokens use 18 decimals via [x/precisebank module](/documentation/concepts/single-token-representation) for full EVM compatibility
8. **EIP compatibility** - Most Core EIPs supported with some consensus-related exceptions ([see full matrix](/documentation/eip-support))

## Core Differences

| Aspect | Cosmos EVM | Standard EVM | Impact |
|--------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Transaction Ordering** | Fee priority and nonce with mempool | Gas price and nonce | Similar ordering with two-tier system |
| **Transactions per Block** | Multiple per account | Multiple per account | Full Ethereum compatibility |
| **Mempool** | Two-tiered (local queue + public pool) | Traditional mempool | Nonce gaps queued locally, valid txs broadcast |
| **Block Rewards** | Native token inflation to validators | Block rewards + tips | Different economic model |
| **Consensus** | Tendermint/CometBFT | Proof of Work/Stake | Byzantine Fault Tolerant with 2/3+ validator agreement |
| **Finality** | Immediate (single block, irreversible) | Probabilistic (12+ confirmations) | No waiting period vs 12-15 minute finality |
| **Chain Reorganizations** | Not possible | Possible | Event handling simplified |
| **Address Formats** | Dual (0x... and cosmos1...) | Ethereum only (0x...) | Same account accessible via both formats |
| **Gas Token** | Native chain token (18 decimals via x/precisebank) | ETH/derivatives | Full precision compatibility |
| **Base Fee** | Configurable (can be 0 or dynamic) | Dynamic based on demand | Chain-specific configuration |
| **Block Time** | 1-2 seconds (configurable via `timeout_commit`) | 12-15 seconds (varies by L2) | Faster transaction confirmation |
| **Cross-chain** | Native IBC | Bridge protocols | Built-in interoperability |

## Gas Price Behavior

<CodeGroup>
```solidity Cosmos EVM - BASEFEE Configurable
// May return 0 if NoBaseFee is true, or dynamic value if EIP-1559 is enabled
uint256 baseFee = block.basefee;

// BaseFee is distributed to validators (not burned)
// Lower-bounded by global min-gas-price
uint256 gasPrice = tx.gasprice;

// Priority calculation for EVM transactions
uint256 priority = min(tx.gasTipCap, tx.gasFeeCap - baseFee);
```

```solidity Standard EVM - BASEFEE Burned
// Returns dynamic base fee
uint256 baseFee = block.basefee;

// Base fee is burned, not distributed
uint256 maxFee = baseFee * 2 + priorityFee;

// Priority is just the tip
uint256 priority = tx.priorityFeePerGas;
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
Cosmos EVM supports EIP-1559 with dynamic base fees, but with key differences:
- Base fee is **distributed to validators** instead of burned (preserving token economics)
- Can be disabled via `NoBaseFee` parameter (returns 0 for `block.basefee`)
- Lower-bounded by global `min-gas-price` configuration
- Calculated using x/feemarket module based on block utilization
- Transaction priority: `min(gas_tip_cap, gas_fee_cap - base_fee)` for EVM txs
- Unlike Ethereum where base fee is burned, Cosmos EVM maintains token supply

## Precompiled Contracts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cosmos Precompiles" icon="cube" href="/documentation/smart-contracts/precompiles">
    Access staking, governance, IBC, and other Cosmos SDK modules via precompiled contracts at fixed addresses.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Standard Precompiles" icon="shield-check">
    All standard Ethereum cryptographic precompiles (ecrecover, sha256, etc.) are fully supported.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
Precompile addresses may vary between implementations. Verify addresses with your specific chain.
</Note>

## JSON-RPC Method Support

Cosmos EVM implements most standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods with modifications for Tendermint consensus:

<Card title="JSON-RPC Implementation" icon="code" href="/api-reference/ethereum-json-rpc/methods">
  View the complete JSON-RPC methods reference with detailed implementation status for all `eth_*`, `web3_*`, `net_*`, `txpool_*`, `personal_*`, `debug_*`, and `admin_*` namespaces.
</Card>

### Key RPC Differences
- **Mining methods**: Return stub values (e.g., `eth_mining` always false, `eth_hashrate` always 0)
- **Uncle methods**: Always return 0/null since no uncle blocks exist
- **Pending state**: Full support via experimental mempool with `txpool_*` methods
- **Trace methods**: Not implemented (use `debug_*` methods instead)
- **Light client protocols**: Not supported (`les_*` namespace unavailable)

## Address Formats

<Card title="Dual Address System" icon="arrows-left-right" href="/documentation/concepts/accounts#address-formats-for-clients">
  Same account accessible via both Ethereum (0x) and Cosmos (bech32) formats. Use Bech32 precompile for conversion.
</Card>

### Key EIP Differences

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="EIP-1559: Base Fee Distribution">
    Unlike Ethereum where base fees are burned, Cosmos EVM distributes them to validators. Can be disabled via `NoBaseFee` parameter.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="EIP-155: Chain-Level Enforcement">
    Currently enforced at chain level through AnteHandler rather than per-transaction. Migration to Geth implementation planned.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consensus EIPs: Not Applicable">
    Difficulty adjustments, PoWâ†’PoS transition, and beacon chain operations don't apply to Tendermint BFT consensus.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Key Differences

### Transaction Execution
- **Two-tiered mempool**: Local queue for nonce-gapped transactions (not broadcast), public pool for executable transactions (broadcast to network)
- **Fee-priority ordering**: Fair competition between EVM and Cosmos txs based on effective tips
- **Nonce gap handling**: Transactions with future nonces queued locally until gaps fill (unique to Cosmos EVM)
- **Multiple transactions per block per EOA**: Full support for batched transactions
- **Transaction replacement**: Same-nonce transactions with higher fees replace lower-fee ones (configurable threshold)
- **Automatic promotion**: Queued transactions promoted to public pool when gaps are filled
- **Deterministic execution**: Same transaction order for all validators due to BFT consensus

### State and Storage
- **No state rent**: No storage rent or state expiry mechanisms
- **Pruning**: Historical state can be pruned based on node configuration
- **Archive nodes**: Full historical state requires archive node configuration

### Network Architecture
- **Validator set**: Fixed validator set with stake-based voting power (2/3+ required for consensus)
- **Validator selection**: Deterministic round-robin proposer selection based on voting power
- **No light clients**: Full or archive nodes only, no light client protocol
- **P2P differences**: Uses Tendermint/CometBFT P2P networking instead of devp2p
- **Block propagation**: Gossip protocol with immediate finality, no uncle blocks

### Developer Considerations
- **Pending state**: Full pending state support via experimental mempool with nonce gap handling
- **Transaction batching**: Send multiple transactions at once, out-of-order delivery handled automatically
- **Gas refunds**: 50% of unused gas is refunded by default (configurable via params)
- **Revert reasons**: Full revert reason strings always available
- **Event reliability**: Events are immediately final, no need to wait for confirmations
- **Block timestamps**: More reliable due to BFT consensus requirements
- **Account abstraction**: EIP-7702 support coming in v0.5.0 for EOA code delegation
- **Opcode differences**: DIFFICULTY/PREVRANDAO returns 0, COINBASE returns validator operator address
- **Chain ID**: Dual system - Cosmos string ID (e.g., "cosmoshub-4") and EVM integer ID (e.g., 1), enforced at chain level (EIP-155)
- **Token precision**: x/precisebank module provides 18 decimal precision for native tokens
- **Storage costs**: No state rent mechanisms, pruning configurable per node

## Known Limitations and Considerations

### Implementation-Specific Variations
- **Precompile addresses**: May vary between chains - verify with your specific implementation
- **Transaction replacement thresholds**: Configurable per chain, not standardized at 10%
- **Validator rewards**: Distribution mechanics may vary based on chain parameters
- **Mempool configuration**: Two-tiered system is experimental and optional

### Missing Ethereum Features
- **State sync protocols**: No snap sync or fast sync equivalents
- **Light client protocol**: Only full nodes supported
- **MEV infrastructure**: No native flashbots or MEV-boost equivalents
- **Archive node pruning**: Different pruning strategies than Ethereum

### Areas Under Development
- **EIP-155 enforcement**: Moving from chain-level to per-transaction validation
- **EIP-7702 (Account Abstraction)**: Planned for v0.5.0
- **EIP-2681 (Nonce Limit)**: Stricter overflow checking needed

This section explores the fundamental concepts that power Cosmos EVM, bridging the gap between Ethereum's familiar development environment and the Cosmos ecosystem's unique capabilities. Here you'll find detailed explanations of how accounts work across both systems, how transactions are processed and protected, the gas and fee mechanisms, token representations, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol that enables cross-chain functionality.

Whether you're understanding how predeployed contracts enhance functionality, exploring the mempool's transaction ordering, or learning about chain migrations and replay protection, these concepts form the essential knowledge base for building and deploying applications on Cosmos EVM.

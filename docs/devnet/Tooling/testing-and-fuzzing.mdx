description: "Key frameworks, libraries, and practices for writing robust, secure smart contracts on Cosmos EVM."

Smart-contract quality hinges on **unit tests, property-based fuzzing, code-coverage checks, and static analysis**.  
The tools below cover each layer.

## 1 — Core Testing Frameworks

### Foundry — Solidity-Native

- Tests written directly in Solidity.  
- Very fast runner (`forge test`) and rich cheatcodes for state manipulation.  
- Built-in, configurable fuzzing.

### Hardhat — JavaScript / TypeScript

- Mocha + Chai test environment.  
- Extensive plug-in ecosystem; integrates with the broader JS tool-chain.

## 2 — Fuzz (Property-Based) Testing

Random inputs are generated until a property fails.

```solidity
// test/MyContract.t.sol  (Foundry)
function test_myFunction_fuzz(uint256 amount) public {
    vm.assume(amount > 0 && amount < 1e18);   // constrain input
    myContract.myFunction(amount);
    assertEq(myContract.someState(), expectedValue);
}
````

* **Foundry**: fuzzing enabled by default (`forge test`).
* **Echidna**: standalone fuzzer for advanced campaigns (`echidna-test .`).

## 3 — Supplementary Tools

| Tool                          | Purpose                                   | Typical Command                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **OpenZeppelin Test Helpers** | Time travel, revert checks (Hardhat)      | see example ↓                             |
| **solidity-coverage**         | Identify untested code paths              | `npx hardhat coverage` · `forge coverage` |
| **Slither**                   | Static-analysis / vulnerability detectors | `slither .`                               |

### Example — OpenZeppelin Test Helpers

```js
const { time, expectRevert } = require('@openzeppelin/test-helpers');

// advance clock by one day
await time.increase(time.duration.days(1));

// expect revert with specific reason
await expectRevert(contract.someFunction(), "Ownable: caller is not the owner");
```

**Next steps**

1. Pick **one** primary framework (Foundry *or* Hardhat).
2. Add fuzz tests for critical invariants.
3. Run coverage and Slither in CI to catch gaps and vulnerabilities early.

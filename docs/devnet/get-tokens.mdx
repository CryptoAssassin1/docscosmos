## Faucet

To receive funds on the Cosmos EVM Devnet you can use [our faucet](https://faucet.cosmos.network).

Wallets may receive tokens up to a maximum of once per 12 hours, and will be topped up only to that amount at any given time

- Requests can be made using either a Cosmos or EVM style address.
- EVM wallet requests will be given a small package of 4 different tokens, plus one ATOM to the Cosmos address for the same account.
  - WATOM (wrapped native token in ERC20 format - functionally identical to WETH on Ethereum mainnet)
  - WBTC (natural ERC20, 18 decimal)
  - PEPE (natural ERC20, 18 decimal)
  - USDT (natural ERC20, 6 decimal)

title: 'How To Get Tokens'
---

To receive funds on the Cosmos EVM Devnet you can use [our faucet](https://faucet.cosmos.network).

Wallets may receive tokens up to a maximum of once per 12 hours, and will not be given more than 1000 of each token at any given time

- Requests can be made using either a Cosmos or EVM style address.
- Wallets will be given a small package of 4 different tokens
  - ATOM (native / fee token - functionally similar to ETH on Ethereum mainnet)
  - WBTC (natural erc-20) - registered to have a representation on the Cosmos Bank module)
  - PEPE (natural ERC20, 18 decimal)
  - USDT (natural ERC20, 6 decimals)

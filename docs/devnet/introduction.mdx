Welcome to the Gaia EVM Devnet documentation!

The Gaia EVM Devnet is a dedicated environment designed for Cosmos EVM builders to explore the full potential of EVM capabilities within the Cosmos ecosystem. It offers a space to experiment with novel applications, test new ideas, and provide valuable feedback to help shape the evolution of the network to ensure your applications' needs are met.

This documentation is still a work-in-progress, with the goal of having everything you need to know about the network and its functionality in one place! If anything is missing or confusing, please reach out to us and we'll improve it right away. Happy building!

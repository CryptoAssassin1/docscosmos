# Bank Precompile

## Overview

The Bank precompile provides ERC20-style access to native Cosmos SDK tokens, enabling smart contracts to query balances and token supplies through standardized interfaces. It serves as a Solidity wrapper around the Cosmos SDK `x/bank` module.

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000804`

**Related Module**: [x/bank](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/bank)

## Primary Methods

### balances

**Signature**: `balances(address account) → Balance[] memory`

**Description**: Queries all native token balances for a specific account address and returns an array of `Balance` (ERC-20 contract address & amount) structures.

**Parameters**:
- `account` (address): The account address to query balances for

**Returns**: Array of Balance structures with contractAddress and amount fields

### totalSupply

**Signature**: `totalSupply() → Balance[] memory`

**Description**: Queries the total supply of all native tokens in the system. Returns comprehensive supply information for every token registered in the system.

**Parameters**: None

**Returns**: Array of Balance structures showing total supply for each token

### supplyOf

**Signature**: `supplyOf(address erc20Address) → uint256`

**Description**: Queries the total supply of a specific token by providing its ERC20 contract address. More efficient when you need supply information for a single token.

**Parameters**:
- `erc20Address` (address): The ERC20 contract address of the token

**Returns**: Total supply of the specified token as uint256

## Data Structures ->

### Balance

The Balance struct represents a token balance with its associated ERC20 contract address:

- `contractAddress` (address): The ERC20 contract address representing the native token
- `amount` (uint256): Token amount in the smallest denomination

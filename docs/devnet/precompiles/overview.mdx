title: "Precompiles Overview"
description: "Precompiles are special contracts integrated at a protocol level, basically to provide a solidity interface for functions that Solidity cannot realistically perform, or that would otherwise be very gas intensive.
Many of these provide access to Cosmos SDK modules for EVM clients"

## Integration Patterns

### Multi-Precompile Workflows
Smart contracts can combine multiple precompiles to create complex operations. For example, auto-compounding staking rewards involves the Staking precompile for delegation management and the Distribution precompile for reward collection.

### Cross-Chain Operations
The ICS20 precompile enables cross-chain token transfers, while the ERC20 precompile provides standard token interfaces for transferred assets.

### DeFi Integration
The combination of Bank, ERC20, and Staking precompiles enables sophisticated DeFi protocols that can interact with both native Cosmos tokens and staking operations.

## Security Considerations

When working with precompiles, consider these important security aspects:

**Authorization Requirements**: Most precompiles require the transaction sender to be the account owner or have appropriate permissions for the operation being performed.

**Gas Cost Optimization**: Precompile operations have varying gas costs. Batch operations when possible and use selective queries to minimize gas consumption.

**Return Value Validation**: Always check return values from precompile function calls to ensure operations completed successfully.

**Address Format Handling**: Use the Bech32 precompile for proper address conversion between Ethereum hex and Cosmos bech32 formats.

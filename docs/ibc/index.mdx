# Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC protocol enables secure and reliable communication between independent blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem. Build truly interoperable applications that work across chains.

## What IBC Enables

IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to communicate with each other in a trustless way:

The Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol enables secure and reliable communication between independent blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Overview

IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to communicate with each other in a trustless way. It enables:

- **Token transfers** between chains
- **Data packets** and arbitrary message passing
- **Cross-chain smart contract calls**
- **Interchain accounts** for remote chain control

## Key Concepts

### Channels and Connections
IBC uses a layered architecture with channels built on top of connections:

- **Connections**: Establish identity verification between chains
- **Channels**: Enable application-specific communication protocols
- **Packets**: Carry data and prove delivery between chains

### Relayers
Relayers are off-chain processes that facilitate IBC communication by:
- Monitoring for packets on source chains
- Submitting proofs to destination chains
- Handling timeouts and acknowledgments

title: "Link Rewrite Test"
description: "Test page to verify versioned link rewriting during freeze"
---

This page verifies that absolute doc links are rewritten from `next` to the frozen version.

- Markdown link: [Go to IBC index](/docs/ibc/next/index)
- Anchor link: <a href="/docs/ibc/next/index">IBC Index</a>
- Legacy doc path: <a href="/docs/documentation/placeholder">Old doc path</a>
 - Release Notes (markdown): [IBC Release Notes](/docs/ibc/next/changelog/release-notes)
 - Release Notes (anchor): <a href="/docs/ibc/next/changelog/release-notes">IBC Release Notes</a>

If rewriting succeeds, in the frozen version these should point to `/docs/ibc/v0.1.0/...`.

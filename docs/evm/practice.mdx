# Practice with Tutorials

Learn Cosmos EVM by understanding its core concepts and capabilities. These guides help you understand how to work with EVM compatibility in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Getting Started with Cosmos EVM Development

### Prerequisites

To develop on Cosmos EVM, you'll need:

- **EVM Development Tools**: Any Ethereum development toolchain (Hardhat, Remix, etc.)
- **Wallet Compatibility**: MetaMask and other EVM wallets work seamlessly
- **JSON-RPC Support**: Full compatibility with Ethereum JSON-RPC endpoints

### Core Concepts

## Development Patterns

### Smart Contract Deployment

Cosmos EVM supports standard EVM tooling and workflows:

- **Solidity Contracts**: Deploy unchanged from Ethereum
- **EVM Tools**: Use Hardhat, Remix, Foundry, and other familiar tools
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, Rabby, and other EVM wallets work natively

### Configuration Considerations

When setting up your development environment:

```javascript
// Example network configuration
{
  url: "YOUR_RPC_ENDPOINT",
  accounts: [...],
  chainId: YOUR_CHAIN_ID, // Cosmos chain ID format
}
```

<Note>
**Chain ID Format**: Cosmos EVM chains may use different chain ID formats. Check your specific chain's documentation.
</Note>

## Key Features to Explore

### EVM Extensions

Cosmos EVM provides extensions to access Cosmos SDK functionality:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Precompiled Contracts">
    Custom precompiled contracts allow Solidity smart contracts to interact with Cosmos SDK modules directly.

    **Benefits:**
    - Access native Cosmos functionality
    - Maintain Solidity development workflow
    - Bridge EVM and Cosmos ecosystems
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="IBC Integration">
    Native Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol support enables:
    - Cross-chain token transfers
    - Cross-chain smart contract calls
    - Access to the broader Cosmos ecosystem

    **Use Cases:**
    - Multi-chain applications
    - Cross-chain DeFi protocols
    - Asset management across ecosystems
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token Unification">
    The ERC-20 module provides:
    - Unified representation of Cosmos SDK coins and ERC-20 tokens
    - Elimination of liquidity fragmentation
    - Seamless user experience across token types
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Approaches

### Option 1: Pure EVM Development

**Best for:** Existing Ethereum projects, standard DeFi/NFT applications

**Approach:**
- Deploy existing Solidity contracts unchanged
- Use standard Ethereum tooling and workflows
- Benefit from lower fees and different consensus parameters

### Option 2: Hybrid EVM + Cosmos

**Best for:** Applications needing Cosmos-specific features

**Approach:**
- Combine Solidity smart contracts with Cosmos SDK modules
- Use EVM extensions to access native functionality
- Leverage IBC for cross-chain capabilities

### Option 3: Cross-Chain Applications

**Best for:** Multi-chain protocols and applications

**Approach:**
- Design for IBC compatibility from the start
- Use unified token representation
- Build for the broader Cosmos ecosystem

## Testing and Development

### Local Development

According to the official repository, you can run a local development node:

```bash
# From the Cosmos EVM repository
./local_node.sh
```

This provides a local testing environment for development and experimentation.

### Testing Framework

The official repository includes comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Testing**: `make test-unit`
- **Solidity Tests**: `make test-solidity`
- **Integration Tests**: Available through the build system

## Key Considerations

### Parameter Management

<Warning>
Both VM and FeeMarket modules have configurable parameters that can be updated through governance proposals. Understand your chain's specific configuration before building applications.
</Warning>

### Fee Market

Cosmos EVM implements EIP-1559 fee market mechanism:
- Dynamic base fees
- Configurable fee structures
- Chain-specific fee parameters

### Permissioned Features

Some Cosmos EVM implementations may include:
- Permissioned deployment of precompiled contracts
- Address whitelisting/blacklisting
- Custom access controls

# Develop & Integrate

Whether converting an existing chain, launching a new chain, or just experimenting, this section covers the basics.

## Integration Overview

Cosmos EVM can be integrated into your chain by importing it as a Go module library. According to the official documentation, the Interchain Labs team provides integration guides and core protocol support depending on your needs and configurations.

<Note>
**Official Documentation:** Updated integration documentation will be releasing soon from the official Cosmos EVM team.
</Note>

## Core Integration Concepts

### Module Architecture

Cosmos EVM consists of three main modules that work together:

    Core EVM implementation (renamed from x/evm in original evmOS)
  </Card>
  <Card title="x/feemarket Module" icon="credit-card">
    EIP-1559 fee market mechanism for transaction handling
  </Card>
  <Card title="x/erc20 Module" icon="coins">
    Interoperability between Cosmos SDK coins and ERC-20 tokens
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Configuration Flexibility

Cosmos EVM provides extensive customization options:

  <Accordion title="Powerful Defaults">
    When integrating all available modules, you get:
    - Permissionless EVM-enabled blockchain
    - JSON-RPC endpoints for EVM tooling compatibility
    - Access to all Cosmos EVM extensions
    - Seamless IBC asset usage in EVM
    - Self-regulating fee market based on EIP-1559
    - EIP-712 structured data signing support
    - On-chain governance control
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customization Options">
    The feature set is highly customizable:
    - **Permissioned/Restricted EVM**: Custom access controls for addresses
    - **EVM Extensions**: Access Cosmos SDK functionality from Solidity
    - **Single Token Representation v2**: Unified token management
    - **Custom Fee Market**: Tailored fee structures or disabled entirely
    - **JSON-RPC Configuration**: Full control over exposed namespaces
    - **EIP-712 Integration**: Optional Cosmos SDK message signing with EVM wallets
    - **Custom Opcodes**: Customize EVM opcodes and add new ones
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before integrating Cosmos EVM:

1. **Cosmos SDK Knowledge**: Understanding of Cosmos SDK module system
2. **Go Development**: Familiarity with Go programming language
3. **Chain Architecture**: Knowledge of your target chain's structure

### Development Environment

The official repository provides a local development setup:

```bash
# Clone the official repository
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/evm

# Run local development node
./local_node.sh
```

This creates a local `evmd` chain for testing and development.

## Key Considerations

### Project Status

<Warning>
**Important**: Cosmos EVM is undergoing changes in preparation for a new audit. The first v1 release is targeted for late Q2. While the original evmOS repo is used in production on several chains, this repository will be marked as stable after the audit is completed.
</Warning>

### Chain Compatibility

#### New Chains vs. Existing Chains

**New Chains:**
- Integrate EVM from day one
- Full flexibility in configuration
- Optimal setup possible

**Existing Chains:**
- More complex integration process
- Requires careful migration planning
- Community coordination needed

### Parameter Management

Both VM and FeeMarket modules maintain configurable parameters that can be updated through governance proposals, providing ongoing flexibility for chain operators.

## Technical Architecture

### Forward Compatibility

Cosmos EVM is designed to be "forward-compatible" with Ethereum, meaning:
- Can run any valid smart contract from Ethereum
- Can implement new features not yet available in standard Ethereum VM
- Moves the EVM standard forward while maintaining compatibility

### Integration Points

The system integrates with Cosmos SDK at multiple levels:
- **Module System**: Plugs into standard Cosmos SDK module architecture
- **Transaction Processing**: Handles both EVM and Cosmos transaction types
- **State Management**: Unified state management across EVM and Cosmos
- **Consensus**: Uses Cosmos SDK consensus mechanism

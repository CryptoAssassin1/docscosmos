Thorough testing is non-negotiable for smart contract development. This guide provides an overview of the tools and libraries available to help you write comprehensive tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and property-based (fuzz) testing.

## Core Testing Frameworks

Your primary testing experience will be shaped by your chosen development framework. Both Foundry and Hardhat offer powerful, built-in testing capabilities.

  <Card title="Foundry" icon="hammer" href="/docs/evm/developers/tooling-and-resources/foundry-guide">
    **Solidity-Native Testing**

    Foundry allows you to write your tests directly in Solidity, which can be more intuitive and efficient for many developers. It includes a fast test runner, powerful cheatcodes for manipulating blockchain state, and integrated fuzz testing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hardhat" icon="wrench" href="/docs/evm/developers/tooling-and-resources/hardhat-guide">
    **JavaScript/TypeScript Testing**

    Hardhat uses a JavaScript-based testing environment with Mocha and Chai. It provides a flexible and extensible platform for writing complex test scenarios and integrating with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.

## Fuzz Testing

Fuzzing, or property-based testing, is a powerful technique where a tool generates random inputs to test that your code adheres to a specific set of rules or "properties."

- **Foundry's Fuzzer**: Foundry has a built-in, highly configurable fuzzer. You can define properties in your Solidity tests, and the fuzzer will attempt to find edge cases that violate them.
  ```solidity
  // test/MyContract.t.sol
  function test_myFunction_fuzz(uint256 amount) public {
      vm.assume(amount > 0 && amount < 1e18); // Constrain inputs
      myContract.myFunction(amount);
      assertEq(myContract.someState(), expectedValue);
  }
  ```
- **Echidna**: A powerful, standalone property-based testing tool for Ethereum smart contracts. Echidna requires more setup but offers advanced features for complex fuzzing campaigns.

## Popular Libraries & Tools

These tools can supplement your primary testing framework.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenZeppelin Test Helpers">
    **What it is**: A JavaScript library for Hardhat users that provides utilities for common testing patterns, such as advancing time, checking for reverts, and handling BigNumbers.

    **When to use it**: When you need to simplify complex testing scenarios in a Hardhat environment.
    ```javascript
    const { time, expectRevert } = require('@openzeppelin/test-helpers');

    // Advance time
    await time.increase(time.duration.days(1));

    // Check for a specific revert reason
    await expectRevert(
      contract.someFunction(),
      "Ownable: caller is not the owner"
    );
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="solidity-coverage">
    **What it is**: A code coverage tool that helps you identify which parts of your codebase are not being tested.

    **When to use it**: To ensure your test suite is comprehensive and doesn't have critical gaps. It integrates easily with both Hardhat and Foundry.
    ```bash
    # For Hardhat
    npx hardhat coverage

    # For Foundry
    forge coverage
    ```
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Slither">
    **What it is**: A static analysis framework that runs a suite of vulnerability detectors on your Solidity code.

    **When to use it**: As part of your CI/CD pipeline to automatically catch common security issues before deployment.
    ```bash
    slither .
    ```

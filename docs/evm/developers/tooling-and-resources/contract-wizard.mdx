The OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard is an interactive tool that helps you generate secure, production-ready smart contracts based on OpenZeppelin's battle-tested libraries. You can use it to quickly create standard contracts like ERC20 (fungible tokens), ERC721 (NFTs), ERC1155 (multi-token standard), and Governor (for on-chain governance).

This is an excellent starting point for any new project, as it ensures you are using the latest security best practices.

---

This guide provides instructions for setting up a local development environment with the necessary tools and configurations for building on Cosmos EVM.

## IDE Setup

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is recommended for its extension support.

#### Essential Extensions

- **Solidity by Nomic Foundation**: Syntax highlighting, code completion, and linting.
- **Go by Google**: Required for Cosmos SDK development.
- **Prettier - Code formatter**: For automated code formatting.
- **ESLint**: For JavaScript/TypeScript error detection.

#### VS Code Configuration

Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "go.testFlags": ["-v"],
  "go.testTimeout": "60s",
  "go.lintTool": "golangci-lint",
  "solidity.defaultCompiler": "remote",
  "solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion": "v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6"
}
```

## Core Tooling

### Node.js

Most smart contract frameworks require Node.js. Install using Node Version Manager (nvm):

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash

# Install latest LTS Node.js
nvm install --lts

# Install yarn (recommended over npm)
npm install -g yarn
```

### Go

Required for Cosmos SDK development:

```bash
# Install Go from https://go.dev/doc/install
# Verify installation
go version
```

### Rust (Optional)

Useful for advanced tooling and performance-critical components:

```bash
# Install via rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Environment Configuration

Configure your shell environment variables in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Set Go paths
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin

# Useful aliases
alias evm-build='make build'
alias evm-test='make test'
```

## Development Workflow

<Note>
Always use the provided `make` targets for consistency with core developers and CI/CD pipelines.
</Note>

### Common Commands

```bash
make build      # Build binaries
make test       # Run tests
make lint       # Check code style
make format     # Format code
```

### Project Structure

```

# Smart Contract Development on Cosmos EVM

Build smart contracts on Cosmos EVM. This guide helps you go from writing your first Solidity contract to deploying real applications with cross-chain features.

> Smart contracts run on the blockchain and enforce rules without middlemen. They work well for DeFi, governance, and cross-chain tasks.

## Basic Essentials

* **Write Your First Contract:** Follow the [Solidity Beginner Tutorial](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) to create a simple "Hello World" contract.
* **Set Up Your Tools:** Use [Hardhat’s Getting Started Guide](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) or [Foundry’s Quickstart](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to prepare your environment.
* **Test and Deploy:** Learn testing and deployment with [OpenZeppelin’s Learn Guides](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn).
* **Security:** Study common security patterns and best practices in [OpenZeppelin’s Security Patterns](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/security-patterns) to protect your contracts.

## Additional Resources

* [Cosmos EVM Documentation](/docs/evm) for Cosmos-specific details.
* Join the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/interchain) and [Cosmos Forum](https://forum.cosmos.network).

Start by building small, testing often, and engaging with other developers.

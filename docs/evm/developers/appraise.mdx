## Detailed Comparisons

### vs. Pure Ethereum L2s

| Aspect | Cosmos EVM | Ethereum L2s |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| **Consensus** | Tendermint (configurable) | Ethereum-dependent |
| **Sovereignty** | Full sovereign chain | Limited sovereignty |
| **Interoperability** | Native IBC for Cosmos ecosystem | Ethereum-centric bridges |
| **Customization** | Full stack customization | Limited to execution layer |
| **Gas Token** | Any available token | ETH or derivative |

**Choose Cosmos EVM when:** You need sovereign consensus, deep chain customization, or first-class connectivity to the Cosmos ecosystem via IBC.

### vs. Native Cosmos SDK

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Development Experience">
    **Native SDK** provides maximum flexibility and performance with direct state access and custom logic in Go. However, it comes with a steep learning curve. **Cosmos EVM** offers a familiar Solidity environment with mature tooling, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for the large pool of Ethereum developers.

*Cosmos SDK Approach:*
```go
// Custom module with native performance
func (k Keeper) Transfer(ctx sdk.Context, from, to sdk.AccAddress, amount sdk.Coins) error {
    return k.bankKeeper.SendCoins(ctx, from, to, amount)
}
```

*Cosmos EVM Approach:*
```solidity
// Standard ERC-20 with familiar tooling
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
    _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance">
    **Native SDK** offers the highest possible performance with no VM overhead. **Cosmos EVM** introduces interpretation overhead, but this is mitigated by precompiled contracts that provide near-native speed for common operations like staking and IBC transfers. For most applications, Cosmos EVM performance is more than sufficient.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### vs. CosmWasm

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Development Experience">
    **CosmWasm** uses Rust, offering high performance and strong safety guarantees. Its ecosystem is growing but smaller than Ethereum's. **Cosmos EVM** uses Solidity, which has a larger developer community and more mature tooling, making it easier to find developers and audited code.

*CosmWasm Approach:*
```rust
#[cw_serde]
pub struct ExecuteMsg {
    SetValue { value: String },
}

pub fn execute(deps: DepsMut, msg: ExecuteMsg) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::SetValue { value } => {
            STATE.save(deps.storage, &value)?;
            Ok(Response::new().add_attribute("action", "set_value"))
        }
    }
}
```

*Cosmos EVM Approach:*
```solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
    string public storedValue;

    function setValue(string memory _value) public {
        storedValue = _value;
        emit ValueSet(_value);
    }
}
```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance & VM">
      **CosmWasm** executes smart contracts in a WebAssembly (Wasm) environment, which is known for its near-native performance and efficiency. **Cosmos EVM** uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which has more overhead but offers direct compatibility with the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

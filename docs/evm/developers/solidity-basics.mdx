# Solidity for Cosmos SDK Developers

This guide introduces Solidity smart contract development to developers familiar with the Cosmos SDK. It bridges the conceptual gaps by mapping familiar Cosmos concepts to their equivalents in the Solidity and EVM programming model.

<Info>
This guide focuses on the conceptual transition. For an in-depth language reference, please consult the official [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/).

## High-Level Conceptual Mapping

| Cosmos SDK Concept | Smart Contract Equivalent | Key Difference |
|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Module** | Deployed Contract | A contract is an *instance* with its own state, deployed at a unique address. A module is a singleton. |
| **Keeper** | The Contract Itself | The contract's code contains all functions that can alter its state, much like a keeper. |
| **`sdk.Msg`** | Function Call | A transaction triggers a single function call on a contract, which is the entry point for state changes. |
| **`x/auth` Signers** | `msg.sender` / `tx.origin` | `msg.sender` is the immediate caller (user or another contract), similar to a message's signer. |
| **Genesis State** | `constructor` | A special function that runs only once when the contract is deployed to initialize its state. |
| **Module Store** | Contract Storage | Each contract has its own private, isolated key-value storage (`mapping`, state variables). |
| **Event Manager** | `event` / `emit` | Solidity has a native event system for logging and for UIs to subscribe to. |
| **Ante-handler** | `require()` / `modifier` | Checks are performed at the beginning of a function, but there's no separate, chain-wide ante-handler phase for contracts. |

## The Smart Contract Lifecycle

A key difference from Cosmos SDK modules is that smart contracts have a distinct lifecycle tied to their deployment.

### 1. The `constructor` (Deployment / `InitGenesis`)

When you deploy a contract, its `constructor` function is executed once and only once. This is the equivalent of a module's `InitGenesis` function, used to set up the initial state.

```solidity
contract MyToken {
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    address public owner;

    // The constructor is called when the contract is deployed.
    // It receives arguments from the deployment transaction.
    constructor(string memory _name, string memory _symbol) {
        name = _name;
        symbol = _symbol;
        owner = msg.sender; // The deployer becomes the owner.
    }
}
```

### 2. Runtime (Transaction Processing)

After deployment, the contract exists at a specific address. Users interact with it by sending transactions that call its public or external functions. Each function call is like a message handler in a Cosmos module.

## Core Solidity Concepts

### State Management (`mapping` and variables)

Instead of a module's global store accessed via a keeper, a contract's state is self-contained.

**Cosmos SDK (Go):**
```go
// A keeper holds a store key to access a part of the global state.
type BankKeeper struct {
    storeKey sdk.StoreKey
}
func (k BankKeeper) SetBalance(ctx sdk.Context, addr sdk.AccAddress, balance sdk.Coin) {
    store := ctx.KVStore(k.storeKey)
    store.Set(types.CreateAccountBalancesKey(addr), bz)
}
```

**Smart Contract (Solidity):**
```solidity
// State variables are declared directly in the contract.
contract Token {
    // This `mapping` is the contract's private key-value store.
    mapping(address => uint256) private balances;

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        // Functions directly modify the contract's own state.
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[to] += amount;
    }
}
```

### The `msg` Global Object (The Transaction Context)

Solidity provides a global `msg` object that contains information about the current transaction, similar to the `sdk.Context` in some ways.

-   `msg.sender` (type `address`): The address of the immediate account (EOA or contract) calling the function. This is your primary tool for authorization, equivalent to checking the signer of an `sdk.Msg`.
-   `msg.value` (type `uint256`): The amount of the chain's native token (e.g., `atest`) sent with the transaction. This is how you handle payments. A function must be marked `payable` to receive tokens.
-   `msg.data` (type `bytes`): The raw calldata of the function call.

```solidity
contract Bank {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // This function must be marked `payable` to accept native tokens.
    function deposit() external payable {
        // `msg.value` holds the amount of tokens sent.
        require(msg.value > 0, "Deposit amount must be positive");
        // `msg.sender` is the depositor.
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }
}
```

### Function Modifiers (The `Ante-handler` Pattern)

Modifiers are reusable pieces of code that can run checks before a function executes, similar to an ante-handler or a decorator.

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    address public owner;

    // This modifier checks if the caller is the contract owner.
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Caller is not the owner");
        _; // The underscore passes control to the function body.
    }

    // Applying the modifier protects this function.
    function changeOwner(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {
        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

## Interacting with Native Cosmos Features via Precompiles

Precompiles are the bridge from the EVM world back to the Cosmos SDK world you're familiar with. They are special contracts at fixed addresses that allow you to call native module logic.

**How it works**:
1.  You import a Solidity `interface` for the precompile.
2.  You call a function on that interface from your contract.
3.  The EVM recognizes the special address and, instead of executing EVM bytecode, it calls a native Go function in the corresponding Cosmos module (e.g., `x/staking`).

This is like one of your module keepers calling a method on another keeper (`k.bankKeeper.SendCoins(...)`).

```solidity
// 1. Define the interface for the staking precompile
interface IStaking {
    function delegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract StakingManager {
    // 2. Point to the precompile's fixed address
    IStaking constant STAKING_PRECOMPILE = IStaking(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800);

    function stake(address validator) external payable {
        // 3. Call the precompile like a normal contract.
        // This triggers the native `x/staking` module's delegate function.
        bool success = STAKING_PRECOMPILE.delegate(validator, msg.value);
        require(success, "Delegation failed");
    }
}
```
This pattern is extremely powerful, allowing you to build hybrid applications that get the best of both worlds: the robust tooling of the EVM and the powerful, app-specific logic of the Cosmos SDK.

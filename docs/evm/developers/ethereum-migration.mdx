# Ethereum to Cosmos EVM Migration Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for migrating existing Ethereum smart contracts to a Cosmos EVM chain. It focuses on the key behavioral differences an Ethereum developer must account for, provides patterns for code modification, and highlights post-migration optimization opportunities.

## Key Behavioral and Architectural Differences

While Cosmos EVM is fully compatible with EVM bytecode, its underlying architecture, inherited from the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint, introduces several critical differences from Ethereum.

### 1. Transaction Lifecycle and Ordering

This is the most significant difference for dApp developers. On Ethereum, multiple transactions from a single Externally Owned Account (EOA) can exist in the mempool and be included in the same block. On Cosmos EVM, this is not the case.

-   **Single Transaction per EOA per Block**: Due to Tendermint's consensus model, which processes transactions sequentially within a block, only **one** transaction from a given EOA can be processed per block.
-   **No App-Side Mempool**: Transactions are not held in a sortable, gas-price-based mempool. They are processed by Tendermint Core's mempool, which generally follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering.
-   **Implications**: This fundamentally changes how developers should design user interactions. Attempting to send multiple transactions in quick succession from the same user account will result in failures for all but the first transaction that reaches the block proposer.

<Info>
For more details on the Tendermint consensus engine and its mempool protocol, see the [Tendermint Documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/mempool-and-p2p.html).
</Info>

**Solution: Batching Operations**

To work around this limitation, you must design contracts that can perform multiple logical operations within a single transaction.

```solidity
// Anti-Pattern: Multiple separate calls from a frontend
// On Ethereum, a user could call approve() then immediately call deposit().
// On Cosmos EVM, the second transaction would fail if sent in the same block.
contract SeparateCalls {
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external { /* ... */ }
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external { /* ... */ }
}

// Best Practice: A single, batched call
contract BatchedCalls {
    struct Action {
        address target;
        bytes data;
    }

    // A multicall or batch function allows a user to bundle
    // several operations into a single on-chain transaction.
    function batch(Action[] calldata actions) external payable {
        for (uint i = 0; i < actions.length; i++) {
            (bool success, ) = actions[i].target.call(actions[i].data);
            require(success, "Batched call failed");
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Consensus and Finality

-   **Instant Finality**: Cosmos EVM utilizes the Tendermint BFT consensus engine, which provides instant finality. As soon as a block is propagated and signed by 66.7% of validators by consensus power, it is finalized and immutable. This is a stark contrast to Ethereum's probabilistic finality, which requires waiting for multiple block confirmations (~12-20 minutes) to be reasonably sure a transaction is permanent.
-   **Faster Block Times**: Block times are typically 1-5 seconds, much faster than Ethereum's ~12 seconds.
-   **Implications for dApps**: Applications do not need to wait for multiple confirmations for security. Once a transaction is included in a block (`eth_getTransactionReceipt` returns a non-null result), you can consider it final. This dramatically improves user experience.

### 3. Dual Address System

A single private key in Cosmos EVM controls two address formats: the standard Ethereum `0x...` format and the Cosmos SDK's bech32 `cosmos...` format.

-   **Deterministic Conversion**: The chain provides a deterministic way to convert between these two formats. See[Key Derivation and Wallet Address Generation](/docs/evm/developers/key-derivation-and-wallet-address-generation) for full details.
-   **Tooling Compatibility**: Ethereum tools (MetaMask, Hardhat, Ethers.js) will only see and use the `0x...` address. Cosmos-native tools (Keplr, Cosmos SDK CLI) will use the `cosmos...` address.
-   **Precompile Interactions**: When your smart contract interacts with a precompile that needs to act on behalf of the user (e.g., staking), the precompile can automatically derive the `cosmos...` address from the `msg.sender`'s `0x...` address. Your contract code does not need to handle the conversion.

**Simplified Example**

When a user with a MetaMask wallet calls your contract's `stake()` function:
1.  `msg.sender` inside your contract is the user's `0x...` address.
2.  Your contract calls the staking precompile's `delegate()` function.
3.  The staking precompile receives the call, sees the `msg.sender`, and uses it to find the corresponding `cosmos...` delegator address to perform the native staking operation.

### 4. Opcode and Fee Market Differences

While the Cosmos EVM executes standard EVM bytecode, certain opcodes tied specifically to Ethereum's post-London fee market (EIP-1559) and consensus behave differently.

-   **`BASEFEE` Opcode**: The `BASEFEE` opcode (`0x48`) will always return `0`. This is because transaction fees are not determined by an EIP-1559 base fee market within the EVM itself. Instead, fees are handled at the underlying Cosmos SDK layer, based on the chain's `feemarket` module or a fixed minimum gas price.
-   **Architectural Reason**: The separation of concerns in the Cosmos SDK stack (where Tendermint handles transaction inclusion and the SDK application layer handles state transitions) means there is no direct equivalent to Ethereum's dynamic, in-protocol base fee that adjusts block-by-block based on demand.
-   **Implications**: Smart contracts cannot rely on `block.basefee` to get a dynamic, market-driven gas price. Developers should instead rely on the `eth_gasPrice` RPC method to suggest a fee, or allow users to set it in their wallets. Logic that uses `block.basefee` for critical calculations may not function as intended.

<Info>
For a deep technical discussion on the implementation details and architectural reasoning behind this behavior, see the [ethermint#1520 pull request](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint/pull/1520) on GitHub.
</Info>

## Code Migration and Adaptation

### Step 1: Update Environment Configuration

Configure your `hardhat.config.ts` or `foundry.toml` to point to the Cosmos EVM testnet.

```typescript
// hardhat.config.ts
const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  // ...
  networks: {
    cosmosEvmTestnet: {
      url: "https://testnet-evm.cosmos.network", // placeholder - use a valid RPC here
      chainId: 9001, // placeholder - use a valid chain ID here
      accounts: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [], // define your key in your environment
    }
  },
  // ...
};
```

### Step 2: Adapt Contract Logic

Review your contracts for logic that relies on Ethereum-specific behaviors.

#### A. Block-Based vs. Time-Based Logic

Due to faster and slightly variable block times, logic based on `block.number` should be replaced with `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
// Unreliable on Cosmos EVM due to fast block times
uint256 public votingEndBlock = block.number + 7200; // Assumes 12s blocks

// Reliable and portable
uint256 public votingEndTime = block.timestamp + 86400; // 1 day
```

#### B. Gas Price Assumptions

Do not hardcode gas prices or rely on `block.basefee`. On Cosmos EVM, `block.basefee` returns `0` because fees are managed by the underlying Cosmos SDK, not an EIP-1559 fee market. Logic that checks `block.basefee` will not work as it does on Ethereum. Instead, allow users to set gas prices via their wallets, which will query the node for a suggested gas price via the `eth_gasPrice` RPC call.

```solidity
// Anti-Pattern: This will not work as expected on Cosmos EVM.
// `block.basefee` will be 0, so this check is ineffective.
require(block.basefee <= 50 gwei, "Base fee is too high for this operation");

// Correct approach: Let the transaction fail naturally if the user's
// specified gas price is insufficient for the network. Do not
// attempt to validate gas price strategies within the contract itself.
```

### Step 3: Deploy and Test

Deploy your contracts and validate functionality, paying close attention to the single-transaction-per-block limitation.

```bash
# Using Hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network cosmosEvmTestnet

# Using Foundry
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract --rpc-url <rpc_url> --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Post-Migration Optimization: Using Precompiles

After ensuring your contract functions correctly, you can dramatically enhance its capabilities and reduce gas costs by integrating precompiled contracts. This is where you move from simple migration to building a true hybrid application.

**Conceptual Benefit**: Instead of re-implementing complex, audited logic like staking or governance in Solidity (which is expensive and error-prone), you are effectively calling a highly-optimized, native Go function from your smart contract.

**Example: Enhancing an ERC20 Token with Staking**

A standard ERC20 token can be enhanced to allow token holders to stake the chain's native asset directly through the token contract.

```solidity
// Interface for the Staking Precompile
interface IStaking {
    function delegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract StakingEnabledToken is ERC20 {
    IStaking constant STAKING_PRECOMPILE = IStaking(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800);

    // This new function allows users to stake the chain's native token
    // (sent with the transaction) and receive a corresponding amount of
    // your ERC20 token as a receipt.
    function stakeAndReceiveToken() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Stake amount must be positive");

        // 1. Call the native staking module via the precompile
        bool success = STAKING_PRECOMPILE.delegate(VALIDATOR_ADDRESS, msg.value);
        require(success, "Native staking delegation failed");

        // 2. Mint your ERC20 token to the user as a liquid staking receipt
        _mint(msg.sender, msg.value);

        emit Staked(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
}
```
This pattern creates a liquid staking derivative, a task that is significantly more complex and gas-intensive on a standard EVM chain without access to native staking primitives.

## Quick Migration Checklist

For most contracts, migration is straightforward. Use this checklist to ensure a smooth transition:

### Pre-Migration Assessment

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Contract Compatibility" icon="check-circle">
    **Standard Solidity:** All standard Solidity features work unchanged

    **OpenZeppelin:** All OpenZeppelin contracts work without modification

    **Chain-specific logic:** Review hardcoded chain IDs, block times, or gas assumptions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transaction Patterns" icon="clock">
    **EOA Limitation:** Only one transaction per block per externally owned account

    **Contract calls:** Unlimited internal contract-to-contract calls within a transaction

    **Batch operations:** Combine multiple operations in single transaction
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 🔧 Required Changes

Most contracts need zero to minimal changes:

| Contract Type | Changes Required | Effort Level |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| **ERC-20 Tokens** | None | Zero |
| **ERC-721 NFTs** | None | Zero |
| **DeFi Protocols** | Review timing assumptions | Minimal |
| **DAO/Governance** | Consider block time differences | Minimal |
| **Complex DApps** | Optimize for Cosmos features | Medium |

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Set up your development environment for Cosmos EVM:

```bash
# Clone your existing project
git clone <your-ethereum-project>
cd <your-project>

# Update your Hardhat/Foundry config for Cosmos EVM
# Add Cosmos EVM testnet network
```

**Update your `hardhat.config.js`:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  networks: {
    cosmosEvmTestnet: {
      url: "https://testnet-evm.cosmos.network",
      chainId: 9000,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
    }
  }
};
```

### Step 2: Identify Potential Issues

Review your contracts for these common patterns that may need adjustment:

#### A. Timing-Dependent Logic

```solidity
// Ethereum block timing assumptions
contract TimeBasedContract {
    uint256 constant BLOCKS_PER_DAY = 7200; // 12s blocks on Ethereum
    uint256 constant VOTING_PERIOD = BLOCKS_PER_DAY * 3; // 3 days

    function canVote() external view returns (bool) {
        return block.number < votingStart + VOTING_PERIOD;
    }
}

// Time-based logic for Cosmos EVM
contract TimeBasedContractFixed {
    uint256 constant SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400;
    uint256 constant VOTING_PERIOD = SECONDS_PER_DAY * 3; // 3 days

    function canVote() external view returns (bool) {
        return block.timestamp < votingStart + VOTING_PERIOD;
    }
}
```

#### B. Chain ID Dependencies

```solidity
// Hardcoded Ethereum chain ID
contract ChainSpecific {
    function isMainnet() external view returns (bool) {
        return block.chainid == 1; // Ethereum mainnet
    }
}

// Configurable chain validation
contract ChainSpecificFixed {
    uint256 public immutable EXPECTED_CHAIN_ID;

    constructor(uint256 _chainId) {
        EXPECTED_CHAIN_ID = _chainId;
    }

    function isCorrectChain() external view returns (bool) {
        return block.chainid == EXPECTED_CHAIN_ID;
    }
}
```

#### C. Gas Price Assumptions

```solidity
// Ethereum gas price assumptions
contract GasOptimized {
    function expensiveOperation() external {
        require(tx.gasprice <= 50 gwei, "Gas price too high");
        // operation logic
    }
}

// Fee market compatible
contract GasOptimizedFixed {
    uint256 public maxBaseFee = 50 gwei; // Configurable

    function expensiveOperation() external {
        // Use block.basefee in EIP-1559 compatible way
        require(block.basefee <= maxBaseFee, "Base fee too high");
        // operation logic
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Deploy and Test

Deploy your contracts to Cosmos EVM testnet:

```bash
# Using Hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network cosmosEvmTestnet

# Using Foundry
forge create src/MyContract.sol:MyContract \
  --rpc-url https://testnet-evm.cosmos.network \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Step 4: Validate Functionality

Test key functionality to ensure proper operation:

```javascript
// Test script example
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function validateMigration() {
  const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("MyContract", contractAddress);

  // Test basic functionality
  await contract.basicFunction();
  console.log("Basic function works");

  // Test transaction ordering (EOA limitation)
  const [user1, user2] = await ethers.getSigners();

  // These should work fine (different EOAs)
  const tx1 = await contract.connect(user1).userFunction();
  const tx2 = await contract.connect(user2).userFunction();

  await Promise.all([tx1.wait(), tx2.wait()]);
  console.log("Multiple EOA transactions work");

  // Test single EOA multiple operations
  try {
    // Only first transaction will be included in the block
    await Promise.all([
      contract.connect(user1).operation1(),
      contract.connect(user1).operation2() // This will be in next block
    ]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Note: Multiple transactions from same EOA per block limitation observed");
  }
}
```

## Optimization Opportunities

Once migrated, consider these Cosmos EVM-specific optimizations:

### 1. Leverage Precompiled Contracts

Add native Cosmos functionality to your contracts:

```solidity
// Interface for staking precompile
interface IStaking {
    function delegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function undelegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool, uint64);
    function delegation(address delegator, address validator) external view returns (uint256);
}

contract EnhancedToken is ERC20 {
    IStaking constant STAKING = IStaking(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800);

    // New feature: Stake tokens while holding them
    function stakeAndHold(address validator) external payable {
        // Stake native tokens
        STAKING.delegate(validator, msg.value);

        // Mint corresponding tokens to user
        _mint(msg.sender, msg.value);

        emit StakedAndMinted(msg.sender, validator, msg.value);
    }
}
```

### 2. Cross-Chain Functionality

Add IBC capabilities for true interoperability:

```solidity
interface IIBCTransfer {
    function transfer(
        string calldata sourceChannel,
        string calldata receiver,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (bool);
}

contract CrossChainDEX {
    IIBCTransfer constant IBC = IIBCTransfer(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000802);

    function arbitrageToOsmosis(uint256 amount) external {
        // Perform local swap
        _executeLocalSwap(amount);

        // Send profits to Osmosis for further arbitrage
        IBC.transfer("channel-0", "osmo1...", profit);
    }
}
```

### 3. Governance Integration

Connect to native Cosmos governance:

```solidity
interface IGovernance {
    function vote(uint64 proposalId, uint32 option) external returns (bool);
    function submitProposal(string calldata title, string calldata description) external returns (uint64);
}

contract CommunityDAO {
    IGovernance constant GOV = IGovernance(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000804);

    function castCommunityVote(uint64 proposalId, bool support) external onlyMembers {
        // Community votes through the DAO
        uint32 voteOption = support ? 1 : 3; // Yes or No
        GOV.vote(proposalId, voteOption);

        emit CommunityVoteCast(proposalId, support, msg.sender);
    }
}
```

## Common Migration Patterns

### DeFi Protocol Migration

For complex DeFi protocols, consider this migration strategy:

```solidity
contract MigratedDEXV2 {
    // Keep existing functionality unchanged
    function swap(address tokenA, address tokenB, uint256 amountIn) external {
        // Existing swap logic - no changes needed
        _executeSwap(tokenA, tokenB, amountIn);
    }

    // Add Cosmos-specific features
    function crossChainArbitrage(string calldata targetChain) external {
        uint256 profit = _calculateArbitrage(targetChain);
        if (profit > minProfitThreshold) {
            IBC.transfer("channel-0", targetChain, profit);
        }
    }

    // Leverage staking for yield
    function stakeLPTokens(address validator) external {
        uint256 lpBalance = liquidityPool.balanceOf(address(this));
        STAKING.delegate(validator, lpBalance);
    }
}
```

### NFT Marketplace Migration

```solidity
contract CrossChainNFTMarketplace {
    // Existing marketplace functionality unchanged
    function listNFT(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price) external {
        // Standard NFT listing logic
    }

    // New: Cross-chain NFT transfers
    function bridgeNFT(uint256 tokenId, string calldata targetChain, string calldata recipient) external {
        require(ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not owner");

        // Burn locally
        _burn(tokenId);

        // Send metadata to target chain via IBC
        IBC.transfer(targetChain, abi.encode(tokenId, recipient, tokenURI(tokenId)));
    }
}
```

## Testing Migration

### Comprehensive Test Suite

```javascript
describe("Migration Validation", function() {
  it("Should maintain all original functionality", async function() {
    // Test all original functions
    await contract.originalFunction1();
    await contract.originalFunction2();
    // ... test all functions
  });

  it("Should handle Cosmos EVM specifics", async function() {
    // Test transaction ordering
    const [user1, user2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Multiple EOAs should work fine
    await Promise.all([
      contract.connect(user1).someFunction(),
      contract.connect(user2).someFunction()
    ]);

    // Single EOA multiple txs will be in different blocks
    await contract.connect(user1).function1();
    await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine"); // Mine a block
    await contract.connect(user1).function2();
  });

  it("Should utilize new Cosmos features", async function() {
    // Test precompile integration
    await contract.useStaking(validatorAddress);
    await contract.useIBC("channel-0", "recipient");
  });
});
```

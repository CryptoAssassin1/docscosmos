### Development Experience

#### Native Cosmos SDK Development

**Advantages:**
- Maximum flexibility and performance
- Direct access to all Cosmos SDK features
- Custom consensus and governance logic
- Tight integration with chain operations

**Challenges:**
- Steep learning curve for Go and Cosmos SDK
- More complex testing and deployment
- Requires deep blockchain knowledge
- Limited reusability across chains

**Example Module Structure:**
```go
// x/mymodule/keeper/keeper.go
type Keeper struct {
    storeKey   sdk.StoreKey
    cdc        codec.Codec
    bankKeeper types.BankKeeper
}

func (k Keeper) ProcessCustomLogic(ctx sdk.Context, msg *types.MsgCustom) (*types.MsgCustomResponse, error) {
    // Direct state access - maximum performance
    store := ctx.KVStore(k.storeKey)

    // Custom validation logic
    if err := k.validateCustomLogic(ctx, msg); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Execute business logic with full SDK access
    result := k.executeBusinessLogic(ctx, msg)

    return &types.MsgCustomResponse{Result: result}, nil
}
```

#### CosmWasm Development

**Advantages:**
- High performance with Rust safety
- Portable across Cosmos chains
- Built-in upgrade mechanisms
- Growing ecosystem and tooling

**Challenges:**
- Rust learning curve for some developers
- Limited tooling compared to Ethereum
- Smaller developer community
- Different security patterns than Solidity

**Example Contract:**
```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{
    entry_point, to_binary, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env,
    MessageInfo, Response, StdResult,
};

#[entry_point]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::CustomFunction { params } => {
            execute_custom_function(deps, env, info, params)
        }
    }
}

fn execute_custom_function(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    params: CustomParams,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // Rust safety and performance
    // Native IBC integration
    // Built-in state management

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("action", "custom_function")
        .add_attribute("sender", info.sender))
}
```

#### Cosmos EVM Development

**Advantages:**
- Familiar Solidity development
- Mature tooling ecosystem
- Large developer community
- Easy Ethereum contract migration

**Challenges:**
- EVM performance limitations
- Gas optimization complexity
- Learning precompile patterns
- Limited to EVM capabilities

**Example Contract:**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface IStaking {
    function delegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract CosmosEVMExample {
    IStaking constant STAKING = IStaking(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800);

    function customFunction(address validator) external payable {
        // Familiar Solidity patterns
        require(msg.value > 0, "Must send tokens");

        // Access to Cosmos SDK through precompiles
        bool success = STAKING.delegate(validator, msg.value);
        require(success, "Delegation failed");

        // EVM-native features
        emit FunctionExecuted(msg.sender, validator, msg.value);
    }

    event FunctionExecuted(address indexed user, address indexed validator, uint256 amount);
}
```

```solidity
// Original Ethereum contract works unchanged
contract UniswapV2Pair {
    function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external {
        // Exact same implementation
    }
}
```

**Enhanced with Cosmos Features:**
```solidity
contract EnhancedDEX {
    IIBCTransfer constant IBC = IIBCTransfer(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000802);

    function swapAndBridge(
        address tokenOut,
        uint amountOut,
        string calldata targetChain,
        string calldata recipient
    ) external {
        // Execute swap (existing logic)
        _executeSwap(tokenOut, amountOut);

        // Bridge to another chain (new capability)
        IBC.transfer(getChannel(targetChain), recipient, amountOut);
    }
}
```

### From Native SDK to CosmWasm

**Go Module to Rust Contract:**
```rust
// Native SDK keeper logic becomes CosmWasm contract
#[cw_serde]
pub struct ExecuteMsg {
    Transfer { recipient: String, amount: Uint128 },
    Stake { validator: String, amount: Uint128 },
}

pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Transfer { recipient, amount } => {
            // Similar logic to SDK keeper, but in Rust
            execute_transfer(deps, info, recipient, amount)
        }
        ExecuteMsg::Stake { validator, amount } => {
            // Leverage existing SDK staking module
            let stake_msg = StakingMsg::Delegate {
                validator,
                amount: coin(amount.u128(), "stake"),
            };
            Ok(Response::new().add_message(stake_msg))
        }
    }

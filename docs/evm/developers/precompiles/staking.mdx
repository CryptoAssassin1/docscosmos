description: "Delegate, undelegate, and manage staking rewards using the staking precompile."
---

The Staking precompile provides an interface for smart contracts to interact with the Cosmos SDK's `x/staking` module. This allows for powerful integrations where contracts can manage delegations and staking rewards programmatically.

- **Precompile Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800`

## Solidity Interface

To use the staking precompile, you can import its interface into your smart contract. The interface provides the function signatures for all available staking operations.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: L-GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import "../common/staking.sol";

// IStaking is the interface for the staking precompile.
interface IStaking {
    // Transactions
    function delegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function redelegate(address srcValidator, address dstValidator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function undelegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool, uint64);
    function cancelUnbondingDelegation(address valAddress, uint256 creationHeight, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function claimRewards(address validator) external returns (bool, uint256);

    // Queries
    function delegation(address delegator, address validator) external view returns (uint256);
    function delegationRewards(address delegator, address validator) external view returns (uint256);
    function validator(address validator) external view returns (Description memory, Commission memory, uint256);
}
```

## Functions

This section details the functions available through the Staking precompile.

### Transactions

<CardGroup>
<Card title="delegate" icon="arrow-down-right">
  Delegates a specified amount of the native staking token to a validator.
  - `validator`: The address of the validator to delegate to.
  - `amount`: The amount to delegate.
  - **Returns**: `true` on success.
</Card>
<Card title="redelegate" icon="arrow-right">
  Redelegates a specified amount from a source validator to a destination validator.
  - `srcValidator`: The address of the source validator.
  - `dstValidator`: The address of the destination validator.
  - `amount`: The amount to redelegate.
  - **Returns**: `true` on success.
</Card>
<Card title="undelegate" icon="arrow-up-right">
  Undelegates a specified amount from a validator.
  - `validator`: The address of the validator to undelegate from.
  - `amount`: The amount to undelegate.
  - **Returns**: `bool` for success and `uint64` for the completion time.
</Card>
<Card title="cancelUnbondingDelegation" icon="x-circle">
  Cancels an unbonding delegation.
  - `valAddress`: The address of the validator.
  - `creationHeight`: The block height at which the unbonding delegation was created.
  - `amount`: The amount of the unbonding delegation to cancel.
  - **Returns**: `true` on success.
</Card>
<Card title="claimRewards" icon="gift">
  Claims staking rewards from a validator.
  - `validator`: The address of the validator to claim rewards from.
  - **Returns**: `bool` for success and `uint256` for the amount of rewards claimed.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Queries

<CardGroup>
<Card title="delegation" icon="user-check">
  Queries the amount of a delegator's stake with a specific validator.
  - `delegator`: The address of the delegator.
  - `validator`: The address of the validator.
  - **Returns**: The staked amount as a `uint256`.
</Card>
<Card title="delegationRewards" icon="award">
  Queries the pending staking rewards for a delegator from a specific validator.
  - `delegator`: The address of the delegator.
  - `validator`: The address of the validator.
  - **Returns**: The rewards amount as a `uint256`.
</Card>
<Card title="validator" icon="server">
  Queries details about a specific validator.
  - `validator`: The address of the validator.
  - **Returns**: The validator's `Description`, `Commission`, and total staked amount.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

title: "Distribution Precompile"
description: "Manage rewards and community pool funds with the Distribution precompile."
---

The Distribution precompile provides an interface to the Cosmos SDK's `x/distribution` module, which handles fee distribution and community pool operations. This precompile allows smart contracts to programmatically manage validator rewards and community funds.

General token transfers are handled via standard EVM transactions or bridged tokens (via the `x/erc20` module), not a specific bank precompile.

- **Precompile Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000801`

## Solidity Interface

The following interface provides the function signatures for all available distribution operations.

title: "Bank (Distribution) Precompile"
description: "Manage rewards and community pool funds with the Distribution precompile."
---

The precompile for the `x/bank` module, as requested by the user, is not available. Instead, the precompile for the `x/distribution` module is available, which handles fee distribution and community pool operations. This precompile allows smart contracts to manage validator rewards and community funds. General token transfers are handled via standard EVM transactions, not a specific bank precompile.

- **Precompile Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000801`

## Solidity Interface

The following interface provides the function signatures for all available distribution operations.

Cosmos EVM provides an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution environment built as a module on top of the Cosmos SDK. This allows for the deployment and execution of Solidity smart contracts within a sovereign Cosmos application.

## Core Protocol and Behavioral Differences

### Transaction Ordering and Mempool Behavior

**Ethereum Mainnet/L2s:**
- Transactions are ordered by gas price and nonce in an application-side mempool.
- Block producers (miners/sequencers) can reorder transactions.
- Multiple transactions from a single Externally Owned Account (EOA) can be included in the same block.

**Cosmos EVM:**
- **No application-side mempool:** Transactions are handled by the underlying Tendermint Core mempool.
- **Transaction ordering:** Transactions are ordered based on their arrival time to the block proposer.
- **Single transaction per EOA per block:** Only one transaction from a given EOA can be included in a single block. This behavior is a core design characteristic of the underlying Cosmos SDK account and nonce system.

```solidity
// On Ethereum, two transactions from the same EOA with different nonces can be in the same block.
// On Cosmos EVM, only the first transaction to reach the proposer will be included.

// Transaction 1 from User A: user.transfer(100)
// Transaction 2 from User A: user.approve(spender, 200)
// Result in Cosmos EVM: Only one of these will be included in a block.
```

### Consensus and Finality Model

**Ethereum Mainnet:**
- **Probabilistic finality:** A block is considered final after a certain number of subsequent blocks have been added (typically 12+), which takes approximately 12-15 minutes.
- **Block times:** ~12-15 seconds.
- **Chain reorganizations:** Possible until a block achieves finality.

**Cosmos EVM:**
- **Instant finality:** Blocks are considered final as soon as they are committed by the Tendermint consensus algorithm.
- **Block times:** Typically 1-2 seconds, configurable at the chain level.
- **No chain reorganizations:** The Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) nature of Tendermint prevents reorgs.

### RPC Method Support

Cosmos EVM supports a specific subset of Ethereum's JSON-RPC methods. As of the latest version, it supports methods up to **v1.10** of the Ethereum specification.

**Commonly Supported Methods:**
- `eth_getBalance`, `eth_sendTransaction`, `eth_call`
- `eth_getBlockByNumber`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt`
- `eth_estimateGas`, `eth_gasPrice`
- `web3_clientVersion`, `net_version`

**Limitations:**
- Advanced debugging or state-override methods introduced after v1.10 may not be available.
- Methods related to Ethereum's specific consensus or mining mechanisms are not applicable.

### Gas and Fee Economics

- **EIP-1559 Support:** Cosmos EVM implements the EIP-1559 fee model with a base fee and a priority fee.
- **Gas Token:** The native token used for gas payments is determined by the specific Cosmos chain, not necessarily ETH.
- **Gas Costs:** While standard EVM opcode gas costs are the same, operations that interact with native Cosmos modules via **precompiled contracts** have unique gas costs.

```solidity
// Gas costs for standard EVM operations are consistent.
// Ethereum: transfer() ~21,000 gas
// Cosmos EVM: transfer() ~21,000 gas

// Gas costs for precompile interactions are unique to Cosmos EVM.
// Cosmos EVM: stakingPrecompile.delegate() ~50,000 gas (example cost)
```

### Address Format and Account System

Cosmos EVM supports a dual address system, where a single private key controls both an Ethereum-style and a Cosmos-style address.

- **Ethereum format:** `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`
- **Cosmos format:** `cosmos1zg3yy3k3xz6k83xz6k83xz6k83xz6k83xzt7h8q`

A deterministic conversion function exists to map between the two formats. This allows users and tools from both ecosystems to interact with the same underlying account.

## Native Capabilities via Precompiled Contracts

Cosmos EVM extends the standard EVM functionality by providing precompiled contracts. These are special contracts at fixed addresses that act as gateways to underlying Cosmos SDK modules.

1.  **Staking:** Interact with the native Proof-of-Stake system.
    ```solidity
    // Example: Delegate tokens to a validator
    IStaking(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800).delegate(validator, amount);
    ```

2.  **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication):** Send and receive tokens from other Cosmos chains.
    ```solidity
    // Example: Transfer tokens over an IBC channel
    IIBCTransfer(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000802).transfer(channel, recipient, amount);
    ```

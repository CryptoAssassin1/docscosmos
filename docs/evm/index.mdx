## Overview

Cosmos EVM brings Ethereum compatibility to Cosmos SDK chains, enabling developers to deploy Solidity contracts while accessing native Cosmos features like staking, governance, and IBC transfers through precompiled contracts.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect to Testnet">
    Add Cosmos EVM testnet to MetaMask:
    - **RPC URL:** `https://testnet-evm.cosmos.network`
    - **Chain ID:** `9000`
    - **Currency:** `TEST`
  </Step>

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

### Connect to Testnet

**Network Details:**
- **RPC Endpoint:** `https://testnet-evm.cosmos.network`
- **Chain ID:** `cosmos_9000-1`
- **Block Explorer:** `https://explorer.cosmos.network/evm`
- **Faucet:** `https://faucet.cosmos.network`

**MetaMask Setup:**
```javascript
{
  chainId: "0x2328", // 9000 in hex
  chainName: "Cosmos EVM Testnet",
  rpcUrls: ["https://testnet-evm.cosmos.network"],
  nativeCurrency: {
    name: "TEST",
    symbol: "TEST",
    decimals: 18
  }
}
```

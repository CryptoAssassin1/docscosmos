Cosmos EVM brings the advantages and capabilities of Ethereum to the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling developers to build sovereign, interoperable blockchains with full EVM compatibility.

## What Makes Cosmos EVM Unique?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ethereum-Compatible" icon="ethereum" color="#627EEA">
    Deploy any Solidity contract unchanged. Use familiar [Tooling & Resources](/docs/evm/developers/tooling-and-resources) like Hardhat and Foundry, and access native Cosmos features via [Precompiled Contracts](/docs/evm/developers/precompiles).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sovereign Chain" icon="crown" color="#22E2A8">
    Full control over consensus, governance, and chain parameters. No dependency on Ethereum's base layer security.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Forward-Compatible" icon="trending-up" color="#FF5628">
    Support for new features as soon as they can be built, through a governance based upgrade process.

# Cosmos EVM

Cosmos EVM brings Ethereum compatibility to Cosmos SDK chains through a modular, plug-and-play architecture. Built on Ethermint, it lets developers create application-specific blockchains that combine the flexibility of Cosmos SDK with the familiarity and collective mindshare of the EVM ecosystem.

For detailed information about the overall concept and architecture, please refer to the [Architecture](/evm/architecture) documentation.

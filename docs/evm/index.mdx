# Cosmos EVM

Cosmos EVM is a plug-and-play solution that adds EVM compatibility and customizability to your Cosmos SDK chain. Build an app-chain with the control and extensibility of the Cosmos SDK, with native support for EVM and seamless EVM↔Cosmos wallet/token/user experience.

<Note>
**Project Status**: Cosmos EVM is undergoing changes in preparation for a new audit. The first v1 release is targeted for late Q2. While the original evmOS repo is used in production on several chains, this repository will be marked as stable after the audit is completed.

## What is Cosmos EVM?

Cosmos EVM is a set of modules for the Cosmos SDK that provides an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution environment. It enables the deployment and operation of Solidity-based smart contracts on a sovereign Cosmos-based blockchain. This allows developers to use Ethereum's tooling and contract standards within a customizable, interoperable network.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. EVM Compatibility

Cosmos EVM is designed to be compatible with the core Ethereum specification. This means that any valid Ethereum smart contract, developed in languages like Solidity or Vyper, can be deployed and executed on a Cosmos EVM chain without code modification. This compatibility extends to the JSON-RPC API, allowing standard Ethereum tools like MetaMask, Hardhat, and Foundry to interact with the chain.

```solidity
// This standard ERC-20 contract is deployable on both Ethereum and Cosmos EVM
contract MyToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("MyToken", "MTK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
    }
}
```

### 2. Native Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)

Smart contracts deployed on Cosmos EVM can interact with the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol through a dedicated precompiled contract. This enables contracts to programmatically send and receive tokens to and from other IBC-enabled blockchains within the Cosmos network.

```solidity
// A smart contract can initiate an IBC transfer via the precompile
interface IIBCTransfer {
    function transfer(string calldata sourceChannel, string calldata receiver, uint256 amount) external;
}

contract CrossChainAssetManager {
    IIBCTransfer constant IBC_PRECOMPILE = IIBCTransfer(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000802);

    function sendToOtherChain(string calldata channel, string calldata recipient, uint256 amount) external {
        // Business logic here...
        IBC_PRECOMPILE.transfer(channel, recipient, amount);
    }
}
```

### 3. Access to Native Modules via Precompiles

Precompiled contracts are a key feature of Cosmos EVM, providing a bridge between the EVM and underlying Cosmos SDK modules. These contracts exist at fixed addresses and allow Solidity code to call functions within native modules like `x/staking` and `x/distribution`.

**Native Cosmos SDK Go Logic:**
```go
// In a custom Cosmos SDK module, a keeper calls another keeper directly
func (k Keeper) DelegateTokens(ctx sdk.Context, delegator sdk.AccAddress, validator sdk.ValAddress, amount sdk.Coin) error {
    return k.stakingKeeper.Delegate(ctx, delegator, validator, amount)
}
```

**Equivalent Solidity Logic via Precompile:**
```solidity
// A smart contract calls the staking precompile to achieve the same result
interface IStaking {
    function delegate(address validator, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract StakingContract {
    IStaking constant STAKING_PRECOMPILE = IStaking(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000800);

    function delegateFunds() external payable {
        STAKING_PRECOMPILE.delegate(preferredValidator, msg.value);
    }
}
```

### 4. Native Token Unification

The `x/erc20` module provides a mechanism to represent both native Cosmos SDK coins and IBC-vouchered tokens as ERC-20 contracts. This eliminates the need for separate "wrapped" token standards, unifying liquidity and simplifying the user experience for assets moving between the native and EVM environments. An IBC token `ibc/ABC...` can be automatically registered and used as a standard ERC-20 token in DeFi protocols.

## Architectural Components

Cosmos EVM is implemented as a collection of interoperable Cosmos SDK modules:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="x/vm Module (Core EVM)">
    **Function:** Provides the core EVM execution environment.
    **Responsibilities:**
    - Processing Ethereum-formatted transactions.
    - Managing smart contract deployment and execution logic.
    - Handling EVM state transitions and storage within the Cosmos state machine.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="x/feemarket Module (EIP-1559)">
    **Function:** Implements the EIP-1559 dynamic fee mechanism.
    **Responsibilities:**
    - Adjusting the base gas fee based on block utilization.
    - Providing a more predictable fee environment compared to fixed-gas-price models.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="x/erc20 Module (Token Bridge)">
    **Function:** Manages the bidirectional conversion between Cosmos SDK `sdk.Coin` and ERC-20 tokens.
    **Responsibilities:**
    - Registering `Coin` denominations as ERC-20 contracts.
    - Enabling IBC tokens to be used seamlessly in EVM-based applications.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Chain-Level Customization

As a sovereign module, Cosmos EVM allows for chain-level configurations that are not possible on Ethereum mainnet or most L2s.

**Permissioned Deployment:** The EVM module's parameters can be configured through governance to restrict smart contract deployment to a specific list of addresses.
```go
// Example of setting allowed publishers in the module parameters
params := types.Params{
    EnableCreate: true,
    EnableCall:   true,
    AllowedPublishers: []string{"cosmos1abc...", "cosmos1def..."},
}
```

**Custom Precompiles:** Chains can implement their own custom precompiled contracts to expose unique features of their native modules to the EVM, going beyond the standard set.

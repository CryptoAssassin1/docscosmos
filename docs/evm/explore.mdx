# Explore & Compare Cosmos EVM

## What is Cosmos EVM?

Cosmos EVM is a plug-and-play solution that adds EVM compatibility and customizability to your Cosmos SDK chain. It is a fork of evmOS, maintained by Interchain Labs and the Interchain Foundation.

### The Core Components

## Key Features

Based on the official documentation, Cosmos EVM provides:

### Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **EVM Module (x/vm)** | Core EVM implementation providing Ethereum compatibility |
| **Fee Market (x/feemarket)** | EIP-1559 fee market mechanism for transaction fee handling |
| **ERC-20 Module (x/erc20)** | Interoperability between Cosmos SDK coins and ERC-20 tokens |
| **JSON-RPC Server** | Full Ethereum tooling compatibility (MetaMask, Remix, etc.) |
| **IBC Integration** | Native cross-chain communication with other Cosmos chains |

## Architecture Overview

Cosmos EVM consists of several key modules working together:

### Main Modules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="x/vm Module">
    The core EVM implementation module (renamed from x/evm in the original evmOS) that provides Ethereum compatibility.

    **Parameters include:**
    - EVM denomination
    - Extra EIPs enabled
    - Chain configuration (fork schedule)
    - Active precompiled contracts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="x/feemarket Module">
    Implements EIP-1559 fee market mechanism for transaction fee handling.

    **Parameters include:**
    - Base fee change denominator
    - Elasticity multiplier
    - Min gas price
    - Min gas multiplier
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="x/erc20 Module">
    Enables interoperability between Cosmos SDK coins and ERC-20 tokens, providing unified token representation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration Scenarios

### When to Use Cosmos EVM

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Existing Ethereum Projects">
    **Scenario:** You have existing Solidity contracts and want to deploy on a Cosmos chain

    **Benefits:**
    - No code changes required
    - Use existing Ethereum tooling
    - Access to IBC ecosystem
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="New Cosmos Chains">
    **Scenario:** Building a new application-specific blockchain that needs smart contract capability

    **Benefits:**
    - Integrate EVM from day one
    - Full customization of parameters
    - Optimal configurations possible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Chain Applications">
    **Scenario:** Building applications that need to interact with multiple Cosmos chains

    **Benefits:**
    - Native IBC support
    - Unified token representation
    - No bridge dependencies
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Considerations

<Warning>
**Project Status**: Cosmos EVM is undergoing changes in preparation for a new audit. The first v1 release is targeted for late Q2. While the original evmOS repo is used in production on several chains, this repository will be marked as stable after the audit is completed.
</Warning>

### Parameter Management

Both the VM and FeeMarket modules maintain their own sets of parameters that can be updated through governance proposals, providing flexibility for chain operators.

### Forward Compatibility

Cosmos EVM aims to be "forward-compatible" with Ethereum, meaning it can run any valid smart contract from Ethereum but can also implement new features not yet available in the standard Ethereum VM.

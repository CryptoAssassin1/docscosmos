# JSON-RPC Support Matrix

The Cosmos EVM aims for full compatibility with the Ethereum JSON-RPC API. However, it is currently based on `go-ethereum` version `v1.10.x`. This means that while the vast majority of commonly used RPC methods are fully supported, methods and features introduced in later versions of `go-ethereum` may not be available.

This document provides a comprehensive list of JSON-RPC methods, their category, and their support status in the Cosmos EVM.

<Info>
A "✅ Supported" status indicates that the method is available and functions as expected. A "❌ Unsupported" status indicates the method was introduced after `go-ethereum` v1.10 or relies on underlying architecture (like post-merge components) not present in Cosmos EVM.

## `debug` and `txpool` Namespaces

Support for the `debug` and `txpool` APIs is highly implementation-specific and may vary. These are generally not exposed to public RPC endpoints for security reasons. Check your specific node implementation's documentation for details.
